       "      <td>Photo by Josh Riemer on Unsplash\\n\\nMerry Christmas and Happy Holidays, everyone!\\n\\nWe just wanted everyone to know how much we appreciate everyone and how thankful we are for all our readers and writers here. We wouldn’t be anywhere without you, so thank you all for bringing informative, vulnerable, and important pieces that destigmatize mental illness and mental health.\\n\\nWithout further ado, here are ten of our top stories from last week, all of which were curated:\\n\\n“Just as the capacity to love and inspire is universal so is the capacity to hate and discourage. Irrespective of gender, race, age or religion none of us are exempt from aggressive proclivities. Those who are narcissistically disordered, and accordingly repress deep seated feelings of inferiority with inflated delusions of grandeur and superiority, are more prone to aggression and violence. They infiltrate our interactions in myriad environments from home, work, school and the cyber world. Hence, bullying does not happen in isolation. Although there is a ringleader she looks to her minions to either sanction her cruelty or look the other way.”\\n\\n“Even though the circumstances that brought me here were sad and challenging, I’m grateful for how this program has changed my life for the better. I can’t help but imagine what life would be like if everyone learned to accept their powerlessness over other people, prioritize their serenity, and take life one step at a time. We’ll never know, but I’d bet the world would be much happier.”\\n\\n“The prospect of spending a horrible Christmas, locked in on a psychiatric unit, was one of the low points of my life. For weeks, the day room was festooned with cheesy decorations and a sorry pink aluminum tree. All of our “activity” therapies revolved around the holidays. We baked and decorated cookies. We fashioned quick-drying clay into ornaments that turned out to be too heavy for the tree. Crappy Christmas carols were background torture. It was hard to get pissed off at the staff because they were making the best with what they had.”\\n\\n“Although I hate to admit it, even if my ex had never betrayed me, I still wouldn’t have been happy. I had set him up for an impossible job — to define me and make me whole. If I cannot find peace and contentment within myself, how could anyone else do it for me?”\\n\\n“On a personal note, significant feelings of loss and sadness can still flare up from time to time. That’s only natural; it’s no reason for self-critique. No matter how resilient we purport to be, we are all emotionally vulnerable human beings. Besides, we aren’t talking about some conceptual loss that we can just mechanically compartmentalize away — we are talking about the loss of our fathers, mothers, sisters and brothers.”\\n\\n“The next six weeks will be hard as cases continue to explode and government leadership remains nonexistent. I can’t control any of this. The only thing I can do is take deep breaths, remain vigilant when it comes to limiting exposure to the virus, and let lots of stuff go. I may always be a hypochondriac, but now that I recognize the beast, I’m hopeful I’ll be able to tame it.”\\n\\n“From anecdotal news reports and informal surveys, there is evidence that for some of us, this pandemic-imposed isolation is a boon rather than a trial. One study on mixed emotions showed that those with lower emotional stability (“moody” personalities) are actually better at responding to uncertainty.”\\n\\n“Every day I wish in my heart and soul that I didn’t have ME/CFS. Unfortunately, I do. It’s a result of a virus I had; 10–12 percent of people who experience a serious infection go on to develop ME. I’ve visualized life without CFS for over a year now; I can smell life without it, I can taste it. It’s in the smell of the lavender fields that I can no longer run through. It’s in the taste of the meals from my favorite restaurant that I can no longer walk to. It’s on the tip of my tongue. It’s in the potentialities; all the things I could be doing, as a twenty-four year-old, that I can’t. I cannot cross the chasm between the potential and the reality. And that’s nothing to do with manifestation.”\\n\\n“Whether it’s cabin fever, redundancy, loss, or general Covid anxieties, this year has caused us to be exposed to more uncertainty than ever. Uncertainty creates unease and feelings of stress. Some of us may have taken this year as one to motivate — plan dream trips, and prepare and be inspired for what the future could bring. For the rest, it has caused us to become irrational, emotional, and reserved.\\n\\n“To be more self-compassionate is a task that can be tricky because we always want to push ourselves and do better. Without realising it, this can lead to us being self-critical which can have damaging consequences.\\n\\nIt’s important to notice these times when we are harsh because we can easily turn it into self-compassion, which is linked to a better quality of life.”\\n\\nMerry Christmas and Happy Holidays, everyone!\\n\\n— Ryan, Juliette, Marie, and Meredith</td>\n",

       "      <td>Your Brain On Coronavirus\\n\\nA guide to the curious and troubling impact of the pandemic and isolation\\n\\nPhoto by cottonbro from Pexels\\n\\nThe coronavirus pandemic frustrates and confounds epidemiologists and immunologists, even after months of study. It frustrates politicians and public health officials dealing with mask non-compliance. It frustrates everyone stuck at home, whether they lost their job or adapting to Zoom.\\n\\nAfter exposure to the virus, it first enters the lungs, using host machinery to replicate. The virus itself is just a genetic sequence enclosed in a protein and lipid coat. It binds the ACE2 receptors on lung cells, with a spike protein located on its protein-lipid coat. This receptor, attached to the virus, trafficks into the lung cell. Here the virus hijacks the machinery of the cell to replicate, damaging lung tissue and spreading throughout the body.\\n\\nThe ACE2 receptor, expressed in many regions of the body, is vulnerable to further entry of these viral particles. The ACE2 receptor regulates blood pressure, nutrient absorption and inflammation. These pathways converge and mediate brain health and disease.\\n\\nThe novel coronavirus perplexed us for many different reasons. A large majority of people who get it don’t display any symptoms, while some display symptoms for many months and others require ventilators to breathe. It is unclear whether someone infected with coronavirus retains long-term immunity.\\n\\nAlso, troubling findings implicate this disease in the induction of stroke and the worsening of mental health. The realization that there are likely long-term complications of coronavirus infection is worrying, as millions of people may require expensive coverage for this new pre-existing condition.\\n\\nThose of us lucky to avoid being infected become more socially isolated and lonely. Many studies report the worsening of mental health symptoms, especially in frontline workers, nurses and doctors. These professionals are more prone to burning out and require extra care.\\n\\nCOVID-19 and Stroke\\n\\nThe cells in the brain require a disproportionate amount of energy to function. When deprived of oxygen, even for minutes, the cells begin to die, leading to a variety of debilitating sensory, motor or language deficits depending. When there is blood loss to a specific region of the brain, cells cannot use oxygen to generate energy. If there is a clot in an artery, fresh oxygen cannot travel to any regions primarily supplied by that blood vessel. These events, classified as ischemic strokes, cause lifelong disability in some of those afflicted.\\n\\nEarly findings in patients found abnormal clotting in blood vessels. Vessels around the lungs or even arterial blood-flow to the brain is interrupted. Thus, individuals infected with coronavirus who suffered abnormal blood clotting as a result, were at higher risk of stroke.\\n\\nIn June of 2020, researchers published a report of neurological symptoms in the New England Journal of Medicine. While they did not report common symptoms of having a stroke, they showed other strange brain-related features. Of thirteen COVID-19 patients who underwent brain imaging, three of them showed signs of an ischemic stroke. A subset of eight of these patients showed other types of inflammation, while eleven presented with a lack of blood flow to the frontal areas of the brain.\\n\\nThough a preliminary observational study, it suggested that the coronavirus impacted blood clotting and flow to the brain. Several studies since identified swathes of patients suffering from ischemic strokes or brain/vascular inflammation. Another study reviewed the current state of evidence, concluding that 41% of patients suffering from neurological symptoms after COVID-19 infection, suffered from strokes. Larger studies however, are needed to decipher how common this is among all those infected with the novel coronavirus.\\n\\nDepending on which region of the brain loses oxygen, stroke may manifest as a broad range of symptoms. If cells die in an area of the brain responsible for motor movement, it later manifests in unilateral or bilateral difficulties with movement. Other common symptoms involve fatigue, challenges with balance or walking, partial paralysis, pain or inattention to one entire side of the body. It prevents individuals from doing the things they do in their daily lives, such as dress themselves or go to the bathroom independently.\\n\\nCOVID-19 and Psychiatric Disorders\\n\\nPhoto by Jonathan Rados on Unsplash\\n\\nEither through neuroimmune signalling or by directly entering the cells of the brain, COVID-19 also contributes to psychiatric symptoms and disorders. It is unclear what role it may play in their pathology, but it may worsen existing conditions or as a contributing factor in its development.\\n\\nOne study compared individuals afflicted with the novel coronavirus to those in quarantine or the general public, finding elevated rates of depression (29.2%) in those with COVID-19. Another small study reported increased post-traumatic stress symptoms in these patients.\\n\\nIndividuals already living with psychiatric disorders reported a worsening of symptoms in two different studies. Several other studies reported depressive and anxious symptoms worsened among essential workers.\\n\\nAnother study surveyed &gt;2000 individuals in Denmark, finding a reduction in overall psychological well-being measures during the pandemics. This study also reported that women were more negatively affected than men.\\n\\nAdditionally, it recognized that many older adults living in adult-care communities during shelter-in-place orders experience loneliness and depression. A study of older adults in San Francisco found that they showed increased rates of loneliness and depression.\\n\\nWe must do our best to check-up on our friends and loved ones. We are all affected differently by the pandemic, so it is important to recognize that the rates of anxiety, depression and stress-related disorders may arise.\\n\\nCOVID-19 Long-Haulers\\n\\nThousands of individuals initially infected with COVID-19, the long-haulers, continue to suffer symptoms many months later. On average, these individuals are women around the age of 44 who are otherwise healthy. Their infections were classified as mild severity because they could recover at home.\\n\\nFacing stigma and in need of a community, several groups sprouted up to support each other. Originally disbelieved, they rallied to raise awareness of their predicament within the medical establishment. It should no longer be sufficient to classify individuals infected with COVID-19, who don’t require a hospital stay, as mild.\\n\\nA few different studies report that most individuals affected with COVID-19 suffer from symptoms months later (Italy, UK, Germany). Intriguingly, many long-haulers did not produce high-levels of coronavirus antibodies. Many individuals experience pain, fatigue and many other debilitating symptoms.\\n\\nThese symptoms are consistent with disturbances in the autonomic nervous system, which is responsible for many automatic physiological functions like breathing or heart-rate but also influence fatigue. Preliminary physiotherapy involves reconditioning the nervous system of patients so that they may regain some of these functions. In his article, Ed Yong states:</td>\n",

       "      <td>Mind Your Nose\\n\\nHow smell training can change your brain in six weeks — and why it matters.\\n\\nBy Ann-Sophie Barwich\\n\\nWhen it comes to training your brain, your sense of smell is possibly the last thing you’d think could strengthen your neural pathways. Learning a new language or reading more books (and fewer social media posts) — sure. But your nose?\\n\\nThat’s because the olfactory system is one of the most plastic systems in your brain. Neuroplasticity describes how the brain flexibly adapts to changes in the environment or when exposed to neural damage. Stimulating the brain strengthens existing neural structures and further adds fuel to the brain’s capacity to remain adaptive, thereby keeping it young. And your smell system is particularly adept at repair and renewal. (Olfactory cells have recently been used in human transplant therapy to treat spinal cord injury, for example.)\\n\\nOne reason for the olfactory system’s adaptive responsiveness is that it undergoes adult neurogenesis. Humans grow new olfactory neurons every three to four weeks throughout their entire life, not just during child development. (These sensory neurons sit in the mucous of your nose, where they pick up airborne chemicals and send activity signals straight to the core of the brain.) If it weren’t for this ongoing regeneration of sensory cells in your nose, we would stop detecting smells after our first few colds.\\n\\nNeural plasticity weakens as we grow old — and so does our sense of smell. Olfactory performance decreases around the age of 70 as the regeneration of olfactory neurons slows down. Yet this process of regeneration never stops entirely. Training your nose helps slow down that decline and offers a great way to increase your brain’s plasticity. That said, increasing your sensitivity to odors in the environment does not always sound desirable. Smell usually comes with negative connotations: that whiff of urine in the metro, that overpowering literal skunk, or that trail of body odor from the person walking in front of you. But paying more attention to the smells around you also has benefits, and not just for a greater enjoyment of food aromas and neighbors’ gardens.\\n\\nRecent studies show that olfactory abilities correspond with differences in cortical areas involved in smell processing in the brain. Johannes Frasnelli, an olfactory scientist at the University of Quebec in Trois-Rivières, explained: “We did some studies where we saw that there is a link between the structure of certain brain regions-like the thickness of the cortex and the thickness of the gray matter layer in certain brain olfactory processing regions-and the ability to perceive.” Frasnelli and his colleagues found that people with better perceptual capacities had a thicker cortex. When they looked at people who had lost their sense of smell, they also saw a reduction of cortical matter in areas involved in odor processing.\\n\\nThat raises the question: Could you change the structure of your brain simply by smelling things? In 2019, Frasnelli’s group discovered that undergoing as little as six weeks of intense olfactory training results in significant structural changes in some regions of the brain (namely, the right inferior frontal gyrus, the bilateral fusiform gyrus, and the right entorhinal cortex).\\n\\nParticipants were given three tasks with a cognitive component.\\n\\nThe first task was a classification task. Participants had to organize two simple odor mixtures by ordering each from lowest to highest concentration. The second was an identification task. Participants were presented with a target odor blended with a citrus scent in a specific ratio (4%). Then they were given the same blend in different ratios and asked to order them according to quality (more citrusy or less?). Lastly, the detection task: Was the learned target odor present in a range of 14 samples of different odor mixtures or not?\\n\\nThis entire exercise was undertaken each day for 20 minutes during the six weeks. Responses were monitored and evaluated on speed and accuracy.\\n\\nSuch intense olfactory training led to a general improvement in olfactory performance. Plus, the increase of olfactory skill was not restricted to the training exercises but also transferred to other olfactory abilities-abilities that had not been tested as part of the training. These perceptual tests included: the detection threshold of an odor, accuracy in odor discrimination (same or different?), cued odor identification (which of these four descriptors is correct?), and even free odor identification (identifying an odor without cues!).\\n\\nIncreasing insight into what the nose knows, and how it communicates with the brain, has broader implications-even philosophical ones. Old (yet still prevalent) cookie-cutter views of the mind coax us to believe that our senses are passive-indifferently picking up signals in the world that are then processed by the brain. Perception, in such views, is a process separate from cognition. Highly plastic systems such as olfaction present us with a much more intriguing and interwoven picture of the mind: Training your nose’s performance (just like other cognitive capacities) fundamentally shapes what you perceive by rewiring the system.\\n\\nYour senses are far from being impartial transmitters; what you are able to perceive in the world ultimately hinges on the depth of your cognitive engagement with it. In other words, your mind does not emerge apathetically as a product of some remarkable, intricate molecular twists performed by the brain. The mind is enhanced by what you can train your brain to do. Just like strength is a result of muscle training, cognitive training of the senses is the bodybuilding of the brain.</td>\n",

       "      <td>You’ve heard of him, haven’t you? Phineas Gage. The railroad worker who survived an explosion that involved an iron rod piercing through his left cheek and out of his brain and skull.\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\nI know.\\n\\nYou’re probably wondering “yeah, alright sweet. What about him?” Well, let’s just say that he was a really popular patient for the field of neuroscience (Cherry, par. 1). And what I found the most interesting about this tragic event was the science of his behavior afterward.\\n\\nFor those of you who don’t know much about Phineas Gage, let me fill you in with the help of my research.\\n\\nPhineas Gage, 25 years old, was a railroad worker in Vermont. One day, at work, he was using an iron rod to handle explosive gun powder. As he was using the iron rod to handle the gun powder, an explosion suddenly occurred. The iron rod then went through his left cheek and brain. Fortunately, he survived and was able to talk and walk after the accident (Cherry, par. 2–3).\\n\\nWhy did people say that Phineas Gage was a “different person” after his accident? It actually has to do with neuroscience.\\n\\nThe iron rod went through his brain, in particular, it went through the frontal lobe of his brain. Does this mean that the frontal lobe of your brain has to do with the kind of person you are? To answer this question, we have to understand what the frontal lobe in our brain is responsible for.\\n\\nOur frontal lobes are responsible for many things. Some of them are higher-order thinking, personality, and decision making. This explains why people who knew Phineas Gage said that he was a totally different person after the accident. Since the iron rod went through his frontal lobe, it means that his personality and thinking, as a whole, completely changed, making him seem like he was a whole different person due to the way he started acting.\\n\\nThis accident and the treatment of Phineas Gage actually played a big role in the field of neurology. His case helped scientists better understand the role of the frontal cortex of the brain (Cherry, par. 16–17).\\n\\nBibliography\\n\\nCherry, Kendra. “The Famous Case of Phineas Gage’s Astonishing Brain Injury.” Phineas Gage’s Astonishing Brain Injury, Verywell Mind, 3 Oct. 2019, www.verywellmind.com/phineas-gage-2795244#targetText=The%20rod%20penetrated%20Gage's%20left,be%20seen%20by%20a%20doctor.</td>\n",

We wouldn’t be anywhere without you, so thank you all for bringing informative, vulnerable, and important pieces that destigmatize mental illness and mental health.\\n\\nWithout further ado, here are ten of our top stories from last week, all of which were curated:\\n\\n“Just as the capacity to love and inspire is universal so is the capacity to hate and discourage. Irrespective of gender, race, age or religion none of us are exempt from aggressive proclivities. Those who are narcissistically disordered, and accordingly repress deep seated feelings of inferiority with inflated delusions of grandeur and superiority, are more prone to aggression and violence. They infiltrate our interactions in myriad environments from home, work, school and the cyber world. Hence, bullying does not happen in isolation. Although there is a ringleader she looks to her minions to either sanction her cruelty or look the other way.”\\n\\n“Even though the circumstances that brought me here were sad and challenging, I’m grateful for how this program has changed my life for the better. I can’t help but imagine what life would be like if everyone learned to accept their powerlessness over other people, prioritize their serenity, and take life one step at a time. We’ll never know, but I’d bet the world would be much happier.”\\n\\n“The prospect of spending a horrible Christmas, locked in on a psychiatric unit, was one of the low points of my life. For weeks, the day room was festooned with cheesy decorations and a sorry pink aluminum tree. All of our “activity” therapies revolved around the holidays. We baked and decorated cookies. We fashioned quick-drying clay into ornaments that turned out to be too heavy for the tree. Crappy Christmas carols were background torture. It was hard to get pissed off at the staff because they were making the best with what they had.”\\n\\n“Although I hate to admit it, even if my ex had never betrayed me, I still wouldn’t have been happy. I had set him up for an impossible job — to define me and make me whole. If I cannot find peace and contentment within myself, how could anyone else do it for me?”\\n\\n“On a personal note, significant feelings of loss and sadness can still flare up from time to time. That’s only natural; it’s no reason for self-critique. No matter how resilient we purport to be, we are all emotionally vulnerable human beings. Besides, we aren’t talking about some conceptual loss that we can just mechanically compartmentalize away — we are talking about the loss of our fathers, mothers, sisters and brothers.”\\n\\n“The next six weeks will be hard as cases continue to explode and government leadership remains nonexistent. I can’t control any of this. The only thing I can do is take deep breaths, remain vigilant when it comes to limiting exposure to the virus, and let lots of stuff go. I may always be a hypochondriac, but now that I recognize the beast, I’m hopeful I’ll be able to tame it.”\\n\\n“From anecdotal news reports and informal surveys, there is evidence that for some of us, this pandemic-imposed isolation is a boon rather than a trial. One study on mixed emotions showed that those with lower emotional stability (“moody” personalities) are actually better at responding to uncertainty.”\\n\\n“Every day I wish in my heart and soul that I didn’t have ME/CFS. Unfortunately, I do. It’s a result of a virus I had; 10–12 percent of people who experience a serious infection go on to develop ME. I’ve visualized life without CFS for over a year now; I can smell life without it, I can taste it. It’s in the smell of the lavender fields that I can no longer run through. It’s in the taste of the meals from my favorite restaurant that I can no longer walk to. It’s on the tip of my tongue. It’s in the potentialities; all the things I could be doing, as a twenty-four year-old, that I can’t. I cannot cross the chasm between the potential and the reality. And that’s nothing to do with manifestation.”\\n\\n“Whether it’s cabin fever, redundancy, loss, or general Covid anxieties, this year has caused us to be exposed to more uncertainty than ever. Uncertainty creates unease and feelings of stress. Some of us may have taken this year as one to motivate — plan dream trips, and prepare and be inspired for what the future could bring. For the rest, it has caused us to become irrational, emotional, and reserved.\\n\\n“To be more self-compassionate is a task that can be tricky because we always want to push ourselves and do better. Without realising it, this can lead to us being self-critical which can have damaging consequences.\\n\\nIt’s important to notice these times when we are harsh because we can easily turn it into self-compassion, which is linked to a better quality of life.”\\n\\nMerry Christmas and Happy Holidays, everyone!\\n\\n— Ryan, Juliette, Marie, and Meredith       ['Mental Health', 'Health', 'Psychology', 'Science', 'Neuroscience']\n",
       "1  Your Brain On Coronavirus\\n\\nA guide to the curious and troubling impact of the pandemic and isolation\\n\\nPhoto by cottonbro from Pexels\\n\\nThe coronavirus pandemic frustrates and confounds epidemiologists and immunologists, even after months of study. It frustrates politicians and public health officials dealing with mask non-compliance. It frustrates everyone stuck at home, whether they lost their job or adapting to Zoom.\\n\\nAfter exposure to the virus, it first enters the lungs, using host machinery to replicate. The virus itself is just a genetic sequence enclosed in a protein and lipid coat. It binds the ACE2 receptors on lung cells, with a spike protein located on its protein-lipid coat. This receptor, attached to the virus, trafficks into the lung cell. Here the virus hijacks the machinery of the cell to replicate, damaging lung tissue and spreading throughout the body.\\n\\nThe ACE2 receptor, expressed in many regions of the body, is vulnerable to further entry of these viral particles. The ACE2 receptor regulates blood pressure, nutrient absorption and inflammation. These pathways converge and mediate brain health and disease.\\n\\nThe novel coronavirus perplexed us for many different reasons. A large majority of people who get it don’t display any symptoms, while some display symptoms for many months and others require ventilators to breathe. It is unclear whether someone infected with coronavirus retains long-term immunity.\\n\\nAlso, troubling findings implicate this disease in the induction of stroke and the worsening of mental health. The realization that there are likely long-term complications of coronavirus infection is worrying, as millions of people may require expensive coverage for this new pre-existing condition.\\n\\nThose of us lucky to avoid being infected become more socially isolated and lonely. Many studies report the worsening of mental health symptoms, especially in frontline workers, nurses and doctors. These professionals are more prone to burning out and require extra care.\\n\\nCOVID-19 and Stroke\\n\\nThe cells in the brain require a disproportionate amount of energy to function. When deprived of oxygen, even for minutes, the cells begin to die, leading to a variety of debilitating sensory, motor or language deficits depending. When there is blood loss to a specific region of the brain, cells cannot use oxygen to generate energy. If there is a clot in an artery, fresh oxygen cannot travel to any regions primarily supplied by that blood vessel. These events, classified as ischemic strokes, cause lifelong disability in some of those afflicted.\\n\\nEarly findings in patients found abnormal clotting in blood vessels. Vessels around the lungs or even arterial blood-flow to the brain is interrupted. Thus, individuals infected with coronavirus who suffered abnormal blood clotting as a result, were at higher risk of stroke.\\n\\nIn June of 2020, researchers published a report of neurological symptoms in the New England Journal of Medicine. While they did not report common symptoms of having a stroke, they showed other strange brain-related features. Of thirteen COVID-19 patients who underwent brain imaging, three of them showed signs of an ischemic stroke. A subset of eight of these patients showed other types of inflammation, while eleven presented with a lack of blood flow to the frontal areas of the brain.\\n\\nThough a preliminary observational study, it suggested that the coronavirus impacted blood clotting and flow to the brain. Several studies since identified swathes of patients suffering from ischemic strokes or brain/vascular inflammation. Another study reviewed the current state of evidence, concluding that 41% of patients suffering from neurological symptoms after COVID-19 infection, suffered from strokes. Larger studies however, are needed to decipher how common this is among all those infected with the novel coronavirus.\\n\\nDepending on which region of the brain loses oxygen, stroke may manifest as a broad range of symptoms. If cells die in an area of the brain responsible for motor movement, it later manifests in unilateral or bilateral difficulties with movement. Other common symptoms involve fatigue, challenges with balance or walking, partial paralysis, pain or inattention to one entire side of the body. It prevents individuals from doing the things they do in their daily lives, such as dress themselves or go to the bathroom independently.\\n\\nCOVID-19 and Psychiatric Disorders\\n\\nPhoto by Jonathan Rados on Unsplash\\n\\nEither through neuroimmune signalling or by directly entering the cells of the brain, COVID-19 also contributes to psychiatric symptoms and disorders. It is unclear what role it may play in their pathology, but it may worsen existing conditions or as a contributing factor in its development.\\n\\nOne study compared individuals afflicted with the novel coronavirus to those in quarantine or the general public, finding elevated rates of depression (29.2%) in those with COVID-19. Another small study reported increased post-traumatic stress symptoms in these patients.\\n\\nIndividuals already living with psychiatric disorders reported a worsening of symptoms in two different studies. Several other studies reported depressive and anxious symptoms worsened among essential workers.\\n\\nAnother study surveyed >2000 individuals in Denmark, finding a reduction in overall psychological well-being measures during the pandemics. This study also reported that women were more negatively affected than men.\\n\\nAdditionally, it recognized that many older adults living in adult-care communities during shelter-in-place orders experience loneliness and depression. A study of older adults in San Francisco found that they showed increased rates of loneliness and depression.\\n\\nWe must do our best to check-up on our friends and loved ones. We are all affected differently by the pandemic, so it is important to recognize that the rates of anxiety, depression and stress-related disorders may arise.\\n\\nCOVID-19 Long-Haulers\\n\\nThousands of individuals initially infected with COVID-19, the long-haulers, continue to suffer symptoms many months later. On average, these individuals are women around the age of 44 who are otherwise healthy. Their infections were classified as mild severity because they could recover at home.\\n\\nFacing stigma and in need of a community, several groups sprouted up to support each other. Originally disbelieved, they rallied to raise awareness of their predicament within the medical establishment. It should no longer be sufficient to classify individuals infected with COVID-19, who don’t require a hospital stay, as mild.\\n\\nA few different studies report that most individuals affected with COVID-19 suffer from symptoms months later (Italy, UK, Germany). Intriguingly, many long-haulers did not produce high-levels of coronavirus antibodies. Many individuals experience pain, fatigue and many other debilitating symptoms.\\n\\nThese symptoms are consistent with disturbances in the autonomic nervous system, which is responsible for many automatic physiological functions like breathing or heart-rate but also influence fatigue. Preliminary physiotherapy involves reconditioning the nervous system of patients so that they may regain some of these functions.

Learning a new language or reading more books (and fewer social media posts) — sure. But your nose?\\n\\nThat’s because the olfactory system is one of the most plastic systems in your brain. Neuroplasticity describes how the brain flexibly adapts to changes in the environment or when exposed to neural damage. Stimulating the brain strengthens existing neural structures and further adds fuel to the brain’s capacity to remain adaptive, thereby keeping it young. And your smell system is particularly adept at repair and renewal. (Olfactory cells have recently been used in human transplant therapy to treat spinal cord injury, for example.)\\n\\nOne reason for the olfactory system’s adaptive responsiveness is that it undergoes adult neurogenesis. Humans grow new olfactory neurons every three to four weeks throughout their entire life, not just during child development. (These sensory neurons sit in the mucous of your nose, where they pick up airborne chemicals and send activity signals straight to the core of the brain.) If it weren’t for this ongoing regeneration of sensory cells in your nose, we would stop detecting smells after our first few colds.\\n\\nNeural plasticity weakens as we grow old — and so does our sense of smell. Olfactory performance decreases around the age of 70 as the regeneration of olfactory neurons slows down. Yet this process of regeneration never stops entirely. Training your nose helps slow down that decline and offers a great way to increase your brain’s plasticity. That said, increasing your sensitivity to odors in the environment does not always sound desirable. Smell usually comes with negative connotations: that whiff of urine in the metro, that overpowering literal skunk, or that trail of body odor from the person walking in front of you. But paying more attention to the smells around you also has benefits, and not just for a greater enjoyment of food aromas and neighbors’ gardens.\\n\\nRecent studies show that olfactory abilities correspond with differences in cortical areas involved in smell processing in the brain. Johannes Frasnelli, an olfactory scientist at the University of Quebec in Trois-Rivières, explained: “We did some studies where we saw that there is a link between the structure of certain brain regions-like the thickness of the cortex and the thickness of the gray matter layer in certain brain olfactory processing regions-and the ability to perceive.” Frasnelli and his colleagues found that people with better perceptual capacities had a thicker cortex. When they looked at people who had lost their sense of smell, they also saw a reduction of cortical matter in areas involved in odor processing.\\n\\nThat raises the question: Could you change the structure of your brain simply by smelling things? In 2019, Frasnelli’s group discovered that undergoing as little as six weeks of intense olfactory training results in significant structural changes in some regions of the brain (namely, the right inferior frontal gyrus, the bilateral fusiform gyrus, and the right entorhinal cortex).\\n\\nParticipants were given three tasks with a cognitive component.\\n\\nThe first task was a classification task. Participants had to organize two simple odor mixtures by ordering each from lowest to highest concentration. The second was an identification task. Participants were presented with a target odor blended with a citrus scent in a specific ratio (4%). Then they were given the same blend in different ratios and asked to order them according to quality (more citrusy or less?). Lastly, the detection task: Was the learned target odor present in a range of 14 samples of different odor mixtures or not?\\n\\nThis entire exercise was undertaken each day for 20 minutes during the six weeks. Responses were monitored and evaluated on speed and accuracy.\\n\\nSuch intense olfactory training led to a general improvement in olfactory performance. Plus, the increase of olfactory skill was not restricted to the training exercises but also transferred to other olfactory abilities-abilities that had not been tested as part of the training. These perceptual tests included: the detection threshold of an odor, accuracy in odor discrimination (same or different?), cued odor identification (which of these four descriptors is correct?), and even free odor identification (identifying an odor without cues!).\\n\\nIncreasing insight into what the nose knows, and how it communicates with the brain, has broader implications-even philosophical ones. Old (yet still prevalent) cookie-cutter views of the mind coax us to believe that our senses are passive-indifferently picking up signals in the world that are then processed by the brain. Perception, in such views, is a process separate from cognition. Highly plastic systems such as olfaction present us with a much more intriguing and interwoven picture of the mind: Training your nose’s performance (just like other cognitive capacities) fundamentally shapes what you perceive by rewiring the system.\\n\\nYour senses are far from being impartial transmitters; what you are able to perceive in the world ultimately hinges on the depth of your cognitive engagement with it. In other words, your mind does not emerge apathetically as a product of some remarkable, intricate molecular twists performed by the brain. The mind is enhanced by what you can train your brain to do. Just like strength is a result of muscle training, cognitive training of the senses is the bodybuilding of the brain.

of him, haven’t you? Phineas Gage. The railroad worker who survived an explosion that involved an iron rod piercing through his left cheek and out of his brain and skull.\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\nI know.\\n\\nYou’re probably wondering “yeah, alright sweet. What about him?” Well, let’s just say that he was a really popular patient for the field of neuroscience (Cherry, par. 1). And what I found the most interesting about this tragic event was the science of his behavior afterward.\\n\\nFor those of you who don’t know much about Phineas Gage, let me fill you in with the help of my research.\\n\\nPhineas Gage, 25 years old, was a railroad worker in Vermont. One day, at work, he was using an iron rod to handle explosive gun powder. As he was using the iron rod to handle the gun powder, an explosion suddenly occurred. The iron rod then went through his left cheek and brain. Fortunately, he survived and was able to talk and walk after the accident (Cherry, par. 2–3).\\n\\nWhy did people say that Phineas Gage was a “different person” after his accident? It actually has to do with neuroscience.\\n\\nThe iron rod went through his brain, in particular, it went through the frontal lobe of his brain. Does this mean that the frontal lobe of your brain has to do with the kind of person you are? To answer this question, we have to understand what the frontal lobe in our brain is responsible for.\\n\\nOur frontal lobes are responsible for many things.

      "Phineas Gage, 25 years old, was a railroad worker in Vermont. One day, at work, he was using an iron rod to handle explosive gun powder. As he was using the iron rod to handle the gun powder, an explosion suddenly occurred. The iron rod then went through his left cheek and brain. Fortunately, he survived and was able to talk and walk after the accident (Cherry, par. 2–3).\n",

      "The iron rod went through his brain, in particular, it went through the frontal lobe of his brain. Does this mean that the frontal lobe of your brain has to do with the kind of person you are? To answer this question, we have to understand what the frontal lobe in our brain is responsible for.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our frontal lobes are responsible for many things. Some of them are higher-order thinking, personality, and decision making. This explains why people who knew Phineas Gage said that he was a totally different person after the accident. Since the iron rod went through his frontal lobe, it means that his personality and thinking, as a whole, completely changed, making him seem like he was a whole different person due to the way he started acting.\n",

Austin was tapped by Obama to begin the process of the withdrawal of American troops from Iraq in 2010, it was an unorganized effort leaving a depleted Iraqi government vulnerable with a military not trained or equipped to quell the rise of ISIS. The disaster did not stop there as Gen. Austin was then given the responsibility of overseeing a Syrian rebel program to combat ISIS that cost us $384 million, which ended in failure after the millions of dollars earmarked to build the training camps were rarely if ever used.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shortly after all of these debacles, Gen. Austin sold out to defense contractors and wealthy investment funds becoming a board member at Raytheon and a partner at Pine Island Capital Partners, who both stand to profit immensely from a Biden administration. With this pick, Biden will be allowed to escape critics in the name of diversity and inclusion as his cabinet becomes an identity politics lottery.\n",

      "The nomination of former Deputy Secretary of State for the Obama administration, Antony Blinken is further evidence that not much will change when it comes to U.S. foreign policy. Blinken is also an investment partner at Pine Island Capital Partners—an indication to where Biden’s interests are. Building back our relationships with our allies, but also continuing military aggression in Africa and the Middle East to secure corporate interests.\n",
      "\n",
      "We can expect an increase in hawkish-ness from Washington as Blinken has openly advocated for tougher stances on adversaries like Russia in an endgame of maintaining power and control. All signs point to the US imperialist machine to continue producing, but not in the name of democracy. In the name of multinational corporations and the almighty dollar.\n",

      "\n",
      "With aspirations of a 2024 or 2028 presidential run, this is as clear a careerist move you can get for Pete Buttigieg. One of the main criticisms of Buttigieg during the Democratic primaries was his inexperience at the national level and working in the Biden administration would dispel that notion in the future. It will allow him to say that he knows what Washington is like, how to make compromises with the other side, and he knows how to get things done for average Americans.\n",
      "\n",
      "Building America back has not just been one of the main focuses for the Biden transition team, but it has also been adopted as his transition team’s slogan—build back better. Buttigieg is also one of the most known figures on the Biden administration and he will be able to build more political clout as he reshapes and reimagines America’s infrastructure while relatively having no experience.\n",

      "In a cabinet position that is traditionally served by a veteran, Biden opted to nominate former Chief of Staff to Obama, Denis McDonough who has never served in the military. Reports found that Biden did not consult with anyone from the veterans community before making this pick, which was a surprise to many senior officials. With the VA being the second largest federal agency, this will definitely be a learning curve for McDonough.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the U.S Census Bureau, post-9/11 veterans have the highest rate of disabilities connected to their military service. An indication that as our veterans become a larger share of the U.S. veteran population, there will be a growing number of veterans who will need VA resources. And with a raging year-long pandemic that has caused a backlog in thousands of benefits claims, McDonough will have a lot of work on his plate.\n",

      "Arguably, one of the most divisive figures in American politics. Neera Tanden worked as an aide on Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign and is known for her staunch opposition and criticism of Bernie Sanders and the progressive wing of the Democratic Party. As a matter of fact, much of the sabotage of the Sander’s 2016 campaign is attributed to the work behind-the-scenes by Tanden and her liberal think tank, Center for American Progress.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, Tanden will not likely face a confirmation challenge from progressives in the Senate, but rather Republicans who she has also gone through a myriad of hostile exchanges with in the past. The reason being that there were worst options for the position to pick from for Biden, such as Brian Reed, chief domestic policy adviser during the Clinton administration, who had a signed petition from progressive congresswomen Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ilhan Omar opposing his appointment.\n",
      "\n",
      "While Tanden is certainly not a pick that promotes party unity, progressives are choosing their battles wisely during confirmations.\n",

      "#RoadtoOscars… Reflections on CAROL.\n",
      "\n",
      "I must confess — I have been avoiding this film. There was something about the wistful trailer overlaid with piano music that signaled the kind of drama I would resent for its resonance, particularly given all the crap I’ve had to deal with in Nigeria. It seems it doesn’t matter what time period or continent I escape to; girl meets girl can never just happen in peace.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Carol, the film’s subtle narrative is sporadically interrupted by reality, be it sudden jolts back to the present from a female utopia with the intrusion of men’s voices; or stunning street scenes that the camera can’t seem to hold in focus. And while watching two women wade innocently towards their curiosities makes for good melodrama, the world all around them, made simple and nonsensical in juxtaposition, brought my own discouraging circumstance to the forefront.\n",
      "\n",
      "I recall an evening my partner and I went out to dinner for a semi-business meeting. One of the men began to hit on me hard, and then put his hand on my thigh. I winced, and after a few minutes of my courage failing, asked him to remove it. I felt my partner freeze next to me, then reach for my glass of water, from which she took a long slip, most likely to keep from screaming. Loud music played in the background. The guy removed his hand laughing, then rubbed my shoulder in parting, almost the way you would pat a dog on the head for bringing back a ball. And our bond broke a little, in that moment, as we shared the dessert he had paid for, and then again, as the two girls who sat across from us chair-danced in sync. No one would know.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Carol, much like being in love with another woman in Nigeria, the building and breaking of a forbidden intimacy in between the tiniest cracks of conversation, lingering moments, and the invisible parts of the mundane carry all the weight, and yet yield so little satisfaction. Girl meets girl and chases a happily ever after that seems to be constantly around the bend, and yet somehow, always out of reach, or dangerous, or both.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cate Blanchett gives an absolutely breathtaking performance (as always). And Mara Rooney, though I don’t quite get the Supporting Actress nomination (more on that later), captures the curious innocence that so many of us, now fully bloomed rogues, can recall from our early days awkwardly navigating the thick hegemony of heterosexuality all around us, burdened by a latent, yet gnawing dissatisfaction, and armed only with a gut feeling that we could be loving, laughing, and f**king so much harder. Incidentally, Cate and Mara’s on-screen chemistry is refreshingly convincing, a testament to the two actors, and delicate direction by Todd Hayes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Verdict: I’m not sure this film will stay with me the way the “Saving Face,” or “Pariah”, pioneers in queer POC cinema did — two white ladies trying to figure out their lives and damning everything in the process, though typical of mainstream lesbian dramas, ain’t all that relatable on the surface. Yet, it’s hard not to appreciate the deference the film grants so many of us, especially those like me, worlds away, who have had to conjure and re-conjure love for each other, and ourselves, within the confines of society’s outdated definition of “normal.” CAROL’s courage to imagine a world in which girl meets girl could end with a happily ever after, though predictable, is perhaps exactly what we need to keep fighting for the same in ours.\n",

      "Experiments are an exercise in confidence leeching. Stuff will go wrong, you will screw up, you will break stuff. The most advanced thing I’ve ever done with my own two hands is attempt to train a rat in a box to press a lever. It didn’t. I failed even at that basic task. The thought of trying to lower a piece of glass roughly the thickness of a human hair through the brain until it touches the surface of a single neuron’s body, without breaking the glass, the neuron, or your own mind in the process doesn’t compute. Getting good data can be a process of confidence-sapping, head-banging floundering.\n",
      "\n",
      "Analysing the data is even worse. Statistics is an exercise in keyboard-snapping frustration, compounded by most scientist’s truly terrible training in statistics, which is no fault of their own. Which were you trained in: the cookbook; the t-test/ANOVA solves all; or absolutely bugger all? Few people deeply understand the principles behind the statistical analyses they do. Even fewer use them correctly; judging by the torrents of anger statisticians aim at each other, that includes most of them too. The already low confidence of most working scientists faced with doing statistics is now compounded by the many high-profile pronouncements that we’ve all been doing it wrong for decades. But with no clear guidance on what to do instead: p-values but no significance level; p-values but more stringent significance levels; no p-values but confidence intervals; no p-values but effect sizes; none of that Fisher or Neyman-Pearson rubbish, use Bayes (factors) — for a different arbitrary number scale to interpret instead. Oh for the heady days of Rutherford’s dictum “if you need statistics, you’ve done the wrong experiment”.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reading scientific papers is worse. To know what is known, we have to read the literature. Every new research paper we read reveals to us something we didn’t know before.

      "The mere existence of the literature is worse. Science is a crushing flood of papers. More papers are published in your own research field than you can ever read. And more are published every year, every month, every day. You can never catch up. The scale of your ignorance writ large by your PubMed and Google search results.\n",
      "\n",
      "And finally, there are your peers. Scientists spend much, perhaps all, of their time with other scientists. This is not healthy. Other scientists are smart. They know things you don’t know; can do things you can’t do; can understand things you can’t understand. All of them. Thousands of them. Go to the annual Society for Neuroscience meeting and stand in the half-mile long poster hall, and there are about 10,000 scientists in that single room that know things you don’t.\n",

      "\n",

      "This cost was clear to us, and we quickly recognized the issue with this immediately.\n",

      "These apps know that there is a tremendous increase in people's willingness to pay for food the later the night progresses, so many times, I didn’t even blink when I saw that $10 delivery fee.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second part of this is that our drunken eyes were often hungrier than our proverbial bellies, and this would lead to us ordering copious amounts of food that we would inevitably not even come close to finishing that night.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the last, and perhaps the most embarrassing part, are the numerous times we ordered food and passed out together in the bed before the food even arrived, never even getting the chance to partake in all of that greasy goodness.\n",
      "\n",
      "This could easily result in a $30–50 extra each night we went out (2–3 times per week), so this could total anywhere from $80-$150 per week, if not more.\n",

      "Dumb Sh*t You Do When You’re Drunk\n",

      "MindMed a neuro-pharmaceutical company, discovers, develops, and deploys psychedelic inspired medicines to improve health, promote wellness, and alleviate suffering.\n",
      "\n",
      "The company is primarily focusing on developing a non-hallucinogenic version of the psychedelic ibogaine to address the opioid crisis.\n",
      "\n",
      "MindMed has initiated or is initiating studies to evaluate potential treatments to help patients with adult attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anxiety, cluster headaches, and substance abuse.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are 5 tailwinds that I believe will cause mindmed to be the Category leader\n",
      "\n",
      "As COVID-19 continues to compound society’s prevalence of anxiety disorders globally, MindMed is pushing ahead with full vigor on the planning and design of Project Lucy.”\n",
      "\n",
      "A Blue Cross Blue Shield report from 2019 found that millennials are seeing their physical and mental health decline at a faster rate than Gen X as they age. Without proper management or treatment, millennials could see a 40% uptick in mortality compared with Gen Xers of the same age, the report found.\n",
      "\n",
      "The stigma for mental health and wellness. is no longer a barrier as millennials embrace mindfulness. and are open to experimentation with Psychedelics and other Nutraceuticals.\n",
      "\n",
      "The movement to decriminalize psilocybin in the United States will open the door for safety and efficacy data coupled with legal reforms generating broader interest in the medical and therapeutic promise of psychedelics, with a growing crop of mainstream media outlets now covering developments.\n",
      "\n",
      "A successful. acceptance of the NASDAQ up-listing could serve as another major catalyst for institutional investor and analyst coverage.\n",

      "MindMed will become the category leader in psychedelic inspired medicines. in collaboration with University Hospital Basel’s Liechti Laboratory, has discovered and filed a patent application in the United States (preserving all worldwide rights) for a neutralizer technology intended to shorten and stop the effects of an LSD trip during a therapy session. This discovery, when further developed, may act as the ‘off-switch’ to an LSD trip.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the many fears and stigmas associated with psychedelics are rare occurrences of ‘bad trips’. MindMed is equipping therapists and other medical professionals with the resources and technology to better control the effects of dosing LSD in a clinical setting to improve the patient experience and patient outcomes.\n",
      "\n",
      "This advancement paves the way for greater therapeutic applications of LSD and shorter-acting psychedelic therapy treatments. MindMed believes this technology, when further developed, may one day be marketed as an added feature to shorten a therapy session and stop a session if the patient is not comfortable.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next decade will lead to further breakthroughs and innovation in personalized medicine MindMed, working with the Liechti Laboratory, will continue to research and build a patent portfolio around psychedelic compounds that create novel approaches to medicine.\n",
      "\n",
      "MindMed will initially focus on the opioid crisis: in the USA, it is estimated that there are at least 11 million people misusing opioids, with an annual cost to the US economy of an estimated $500 billion. Existing addiction treatments have been inadequate, and the FDA has provided incentives for effective opioid treatments, including accelerated approval and “breakthrough” designation for the development of treatments for opioid use disorders, and a lowered threshold for approval — accepting a standard of fewer occasions per day. MindMed intends to leverage and develop its existing intellectual property in treating opioid use disorder, in particular its 18-MC molecule, which is a synthetic congener of the ibogaine plant, and which has been proven effective in the past for treating addictions. In early tests, 18-MC appears to have retained these anti- addictive properties while eliminating the downsides of ibogaine use, including a risk of cardiac toxicity, a lengthy hallucinogenic experience, and being a banned substance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Quantitive\n",
      "\n",
      "On July 28, 2020, MindMed concluded dosing in a Phase 1 Single Ascending Dose (SAD) study of 18-MC. The dosing of 18-MC was well tolerated in humans and will help advance planning for a Phase 2a clinical trial in opioid addiction. Further, the study has not incurred any delays due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the Multiple Ascending Dose (MAD) study is on track according to the original development timeline. MindMed plans to begin the Phase 2a study of 18-MC in opioid addiction by the end of this year.\n",
      "\n",
      "MindMed will pursue N-N-Dimethyltryptamine (DMT), the principally active ingredient in Ayahuasca. MindMed is providing startup funding for a Phase 1 clinical trial testing various intravenous dosing regimens of DMT, expected to begin in Q4 of 2020.\n",

      "The Red Queen’s race\n",
      "\n",
      "In Lewis Carroll’s Through the Looking-Glass, The Red Queen’s race is an event where The Red Queen and Alice are frantically running but don’t move. This is the exchange they have while out of breath afterwards.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, in our country,” said Alice, still panting a little, “you’d generally get to somewhere else — if you run very fast for a long time, as we’ve been doing.” “A slow sort of country!” said the Queen. “Now, here, you see, it takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place. If you want to get somewhere else, you must run at least twice as fast as that!”\n",
      "\n",
      "In evolutionary biology, the red queen’s race is used to illustrate that sexual reproduction and the resulting genetic recombination may be just enough to allow individuals of a certain species to adapt to changes in their environment. More importantly however, it is also used in environmental sociology by Allan Schnaiberg’s idea of the Treadmill of Production. In this example producers are continually driven to accumulate capital and expand the market in an effort to maintain relative economic and social position. Much like an evolutionary game-theoretic biological system.\n",
      "\n",
      "These evolutionary forces dictating the direction of evolution are well understood. Utilising statistics game-theoretic models are able to predict the spread of a genome, they conclude that,\n",
      "\n",
      "Targeted experiments based on our computational results could further help assess the BQ [Black Queen] Hypothesis.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Black Queen\n",
      "\n",
      "The Black Queen hypothesis is based on the card game Hearts. The significant rule in the game for this analogy is that the queen of spades, which must end up in a player’s deck, carries a very large penalty. The biological theory is that it can be beneficial for a cell to lose vital functions (i.e., losing the ability to process Sulpha) if the surrounding cells are able to fulfil that function for them. The main driver for this would be that the individual cells become more metabolically efficient as they no longer have to provide the function for themselves, allowing cells to specialize. There are again parallels here with business: if the KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) in a business model are correctly identified, it would stand to reason that these metrics can be used within similar biological models described above. The forces acting on both nature and businesses are measurable, thus can be modelled and tested.\n",
      "\n",
      "Equal and opposite\n",
      "\n",
      "Using the kind of thinking from above we maybe able to understand the secret to Bitcoin’s success. Why is Bitcoin able to resist attacks and what are the mechanisms behind that resistance? To answer this question we must look in detail at Bitcoin’s genome or the technical details of the way Bitcoin has been constructed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Bitcoin network, made up of miners, takes a snapshot of time roughly every 10 minutes via the probabilistic Proof of Work (POW) mechanism. Companies that decide to take on this process wherein they reward themselves every time they produce a valid snapshot are known as miners. This reward includes a subsidy and transaction fees. In order to validate other miners are worthy of their reward, each miner checks their competitors’ attempt at solving the proof of work by observing the blocks they produce. Other miners will only accept their work if it contains no double spends and follows a given rule set. It is this incentive mechanism that guards the network against would-be attackers that wish to double spend. Miners are encouraged to propagate their work as fast as possible to ensure their effort, money and time is not wasted on invalid blocks due to a competitor’s block orphaning theirs.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fact that miners must follow the longest valid proof-of-work chain creates a balanced incentive mechanism. Not only to propagate the block being worked on top of as quickly as possible but also to validate incoming blocks as quickly as possible. The transition from one block to the next block is an important one, it must be done both quickly and with managed risk. As we know, if a miner begins working on top of an invalid block, the work is wasted. Yet to ensure that they are not left behind, work must be commenced on a valid block as soon as possible. This may mean that work begins before all aspects of an incoming block are validated.\n",
      "\n",
      "The image illustrates this as a free body force diagram where miner ‘A’ has found a block and is positively incentivised (F1) to propagate their block as soon as possible. Miner ‘B’ who is receiving the block is positively incentivised (F2) to receive and validate the block as soon as possible. The weakening of either incentive would be a detriment to the system as a whole. The dictum to assume that everyone is always trying to attack is one that miners should not take lightly. One mistake could cost them everything that their business has been built upon. This financial force could be seen as a Key Performance Indicator of the Bitcoin network.\n",
      "\n",
      "A seat at the table\n",
      "\n",
      "Imagine a party of miners sitting at a table. A miner that is not sitting directly at the table, and thus not well connected, collects less revenue through mining fees due to not receiving transactions in a timely manner from other miners. They also experience more orphans due to not being able to communicate the block fast enough. All of which results in a loss of revenue for that individual miner and increased revenue for all other miners.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is an evolutionary type mechanism, described by both the red and black queen hypothesis, just the same as in biology or in economic capitalism. This is the economic effect that determines which miners will be able to compete to find blocks; if they produce too many blocks that are orphaned they will not be able to make a profit and will find that they lose their seat at the table. Once we understand what mechanisms cause miners to be tightly connected we can understand the core technical and economic properties of the system.\n",
      "\n",
      "Propagation\n",
      "\n",
      "Both transactions and blocks are broadcast on a best effort basis. The exact mechanism used to propagate the information is not relevant to any of the core design on the Bitcoin protocol. However, it can have an effect on the core protocol if adjustments are made to Bitcoins economic protocol that might allow propagation to become more efficient, however the mechanisms proposed to increase block or transaction propagation time may not even achieve that. If propagation times are given as a reason to alter the Bitcoin protocol we must be very aware of how exactly this is achieved if anyone is asking for consensus changes primarily because the networking protocol should never need consensus altering changes. If a miner elects to use a different networking protocol and others cannot connect to them, this miner isolates themselves from the other miners.\n",
      "\n",
      "Current and proposed methods of propagation are beyond the scope of this series as they are not protected by a consensus mechanism. It is much more like a language spoken between miners but has no effect on the way they process information they are given. Each miner can agree on different languages between themselves yet can work on the same protocol. There is no risk of one miner creating a block that is seen as invalid by some and valid by others so long as each miner has all the same information to complete the block.\n",
      "\n",
      "Validation\n",
      "\n",
      "Transactions\n",
      "\n",
      "As we are going over the validation process for blocks it is worth mentioning the validation process for transactions. As soon as a new transaction is seen on the network a number of conditions need to be met for it to be accepted and thus enter the blockchain. These conditions involve a verification that the signatures are valid, the input is greater than the output, unless it is a coinbase transaction in which case there is no input, and there is a valid parent transaction. If any of these conditions are not met the transaction is rejected by being flagged, kept in memory as an incident and an alert is propagated throughout the network. Keeping the transaction in memory and propagating an alert is not vital however, it may help miners spot a pattern in malicious behaviour. There is also a loop that can be used to control a miners risk level to attacks, if there is a very large transaction chain that a miner does not have and is given the final transaction first a miner may find themselves continuously requesting data from their peers. The ‘j’ parameter will allow a miner to stop this loop and black list a peer that is behaving maliciously.\n",
      "\n",
      "Blocks\n",
      "\n",
      "The miner that is more connected and can produce blocks that are easiest to validate will find themselves at an advantage due to lower orphan rates, which again, cost the miners in revenue and profit. The opposite side of this is that the miner that is able to validate blocks the fastest will also have an advantage. Above is a simplified process which miners may choose to follow to ensure that they are on the longest valid chain for as long as possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "A rule of this process is that the first valid block received is the one worked on. That means the block that validates first is the one that is to be considered part of the valid chain. Therefore if a block takes too long to download or validate the miner either reverts back to the previously saved block, or transitions to a competing block that is found to be valid first. One may notice that only one loop exists within this flow chart. It is this loop that miners can use to manage their risk level by setting the value of ‘k’. This is similar to the ‘j’ parameter used to protect against a DDoS attack for transactions. However, it is much more important. If this value is set incorrectly it is not just a transaction fee that is missed, but an entire block reward. If other miners accept and build upon the block just rejected by the miner under discussion, then it becomes the longest chain and work has been wasted.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is also worth mentioning that a miner cannot produce a block larger than one that they are not able to validate as part of the building process is the act of validation. Only a more efficient or more connected miner may be able to produce a block that others cannot produce in the given time between blocks. These more efficient and resilient miners can faster adapt changing market demand for block space and are thus more competitive. They therefore may build blocks in accordance with a competitive economic strategy, in which a miner produces a large block that 51% of the network can validate whilst the other 49% find difficult to and thus fall behind.\n",
      "\n",
      "Where are we going?\n",
      "\n",
      "In this section we have outlined the validation process and identified two potential Key Performance Indicators (KPI) of the mining business. This KPI is a risk mitigation factor which will directly affect their profits and therefore chances of survival.\n",
      "\n",
      "While this knowledge is not new or revolutionary, it is the underpinnings of how Bitcoin functions. Without understanding this it is difficult to have constructive conversations about the direction of the protocol. We are laying the groundwork for further more complex discussions. One may also notice that the processes above, although they are linear, allow transaction validation and tree construction to be parallelised. Chained transactions can be validated by a single thread, and the merkle tree can be built in sections. This will also be covered in more detail in the next block.\n",

I do have one specific memory of a time when I was about 16 and realized that my parents had just done the deed. As kids, thinking about our parents getting it on was enough to make us run wide-eyed from the room. Now that I\\u2019m the parent, I realize how much having children can complicate having an active sex life.\\n\\nMy kids are 9 and 13, so there\\u2019s no more nookie when the kids are napping. Having a fulfilling sex life when you\\u2019ve got a family to manage is challenging. With one or both parents often exhausted at day\\u2019s end, it\\u2019s common to let too much time slip by without finding moments to really connect. Over the years I\\u2019ve picked up some tricks that make having an active sex life a little bit easier.\\n\\nGet a lock.\\n\\nHaving sex with kids in the house and no lock means a part of your brain is ALWAYS listening and anticipating the opening of your bedroom door. It\\u2019s hard to lose yourself in a moment when you\\u2019re using brainpower to fear the end of the moment. Installing a new doorknob is insanely easy, and probably the best step you can take in rebuilding your sex life once your kids are big enough to open doors.\\n\\nMake out like teenagers.\\n\\nMaintaining an intimate relationship doesn\\u2019t always have to be about intercourse. Too tired for a full on romp in the sheets? How about just some heavy petting? Removing the expectation of physical escalation can lead to stress-free, amazing connection time. Most of us experienced a time in life when kissing was the most exciting thing in the world and making out for an hour or more was just about the best way to spend our time. Don\\u2019t be afraid to go back.\\n\\nWhen is the last time you gave your partner more than a peck? That you really let yourself explore and go deep into that kiss? Bonus: if you get interrupted before you things a chance to move any further, you can consider it an appetizer that builds anticipation for the next time.\\n\\nTake advantage of the quiet moments.\\n\\nYou wake up at 4 a.m. to go to the bathroom, and when you climb back into bed, your partner rolls over sleepily to cuddle up next to you. Taking advantage of these small moments is so worth the extra cup of coffee you\\u2019ll need in the morning. There\\u2019s something about being intimate in the small hours of the morning when the house is dark and the world is asleep that makes it feel like you\\u2019re in your own little world. Plus, you don\\u2019t have to feel guilty about rolling over and going back to sleep afterwards, because it\\u2019s not time to be up yet!\\n\\nMake screen time your sexy time.\\n\\nWe limit screen time in our house to an hour a day, and both kids do it at a scheduled time. Since their time is limited, they\\u2019re usually pretty focused on what they\\u2019re doing and couldn\\u2019t care less what we\\u2019re up to. All screen time happens in the common areas, so it\\u2019s a great time for us to sneak off to our bedroom.\\n\\nGiving the kids a few extra minutes once in a while means a little bit more time for us to connect while they\\u2019re off in You-Tube or Roblox land. It also means we have a built in time each day where we can make a conscious choice to focus on us.\\n\\nSometimes, choose quantity over quality.\\n\\nQuickies are underrated. I\\u2019ll take a five minute fast and dirty romp over nothing any day of the week. It may seem like a short connection, but then you put your pants back on and for the rest of the day/night, you end up exchanging knowing glances and looks that speak volumes about what might happen when you\\u2019ve got just a little bit more time. There\\u2019s something about a physical reminder of the chemistry you feel, whether you spend five minutes basking in it or an hour, it will affect your day for the better.\\n\\nTurn limitations into games.\\n\\nPaper thin walls can feel like a pain in the ass, but they can also make for some really fun challenges. If the kids are in the other room, make the fact that you can\\u2019t talk a game. See how it feels when your partner whispers in your ear, \\u201cnow, don\\u2019t make a sound, someone might hear you.\\u201d Put your hand over their mouth and give them a look that says \\u201cdon\\u2019t make a peep.\\u201d Spice can come from unexpected places \\u2014 embrace it!\\n\\nUse regular tasks to sneak in sexy time.\\n\\nIf garbage day is Friday, your kids are probably used to one of you disappearing for a few minutes on Thursday night to sort recycling and take the bins out to the curb. Chores like this create the opportunity to turn something boring your kids don\\u2019t want to help with into a little bit of alone time. Tell them you\\u2019re helping with the recycling this week, and steal a few minutes to focus on each other.\\n\\nThink outside the box.\\n\\nWhen is the last time you climbed into the shower with your significant other? Bathroom doors almost always lock, and the sound of running water is a great dampener for other noises you might make. Laundry room or office the only room in your house with a lock? Take advantage of it!\\n\\nSex in public makes me wary, but sex in the backyard shed when you\\u2019re outside \\u201cweeding\\u201d and \\u201cmowing the lawn?\\u201d Why not! Sneaking in through the back door after a run and smashing sweaty bodies in the guest bathroom? Delicious.\\n\\nGet comfortable telling your kids to go away.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s a weekend morning and your partner has gotten up with the kids. At the agreed-upon to time, they come in to wake you, and crawl into bed with you. Within seconds, the kids knock on the locked door. \\u201cCan I come in?\\u201d No, no you can\\u2019t. \\u201cWhy not?\\u201d\\n\\nThis was my life last Sunday, and a simple reply of \\u201cI\\u2019m waking up your mom\\u201d sent our nonplussed kids back into the living room to play and read while we shared some quality time. It\\u2019s easy to make the kids your center of attention all the time, but in reality they can take care of themselves for a few minutes, especially when they get a bit older. They weren\\u2019t upset and didn\\u2019t actually need anything, and I felt zero guilt about sending them away.\\n\\nLearn how to sext.\\n\\nWaiting until you\\u2019re alone to stoke the fire might mean spending most nights cold. Text messages are great because you can send them anytime, anywhere. Remember when you were dating, and didn\\u2019t get to see your partner every day? In between, phone calls and text messages would build that anticipation until you couldn\\u2019t wait to be touching again.\\n\\nSexy selfies and racy messages aren\\u2019t just for millennials, they\\u2019re for everybody! You\\u2019d be surprised at the efficacy of a quick snapshot of your new bra or your butt in those jeans that fit just right snapped & sent from the bathroom at work. Try sending a racy message to your partner from across the room during family game night, and just watch that fire appear in their eyes when they look up at you.\\n\\nSchedule it.\\n\\nI know, this sounds unsexy. But hear me out. We all have things we look forward to on a regular basis. I look forward to every other Thursday night, when I know I\\u2019ve got a three day weekend ahead. I look forward to the third Wednesday of the month when I get to attend my local polyamory discussion group. People look forward to standing coffee or lunch dates, paydays, the day you they know their monthly subscription box arrives. What if you built in that excited anticipation about sex too?\\n\\nKnowing that you\\u2019ve got some fun, sexy, let-it-loose time coming with your partner can be a great motivator to get through days that are just dragging by. Realistically, as kids get older, calendars get fuller. Work events, school events, family functions, and extracurriculars fill up the calendar. There\\u2019s something to be said for applying the same intention you apply to those activities to nurturing an intimate relationship with your partner.\\n\\nSpecial, long, luxurious or kinky afternoons in bed are fantastic, but sex doesn\\u2019t have to mean a ton of effort and preparation. Sometimes, the most memorable times come when your kid is distracted by YouTube for ten minutes, and your honey bends you over the washing machine and reminds you that they find you just as sexy as the day you met.\\n\\nLooking back on it now, I\\u2019m glad that my parents also took the time to find that connection for themselves, and I hope that I\\u2019m giving my kids the sex-positive upbringing that will let them do the same.\\n\\nYou might also enjoy\\u2026\", \"row_index\": 13923, \"stack_trace\": \"NoneType: None\\n\"}\n"

      "{\"timestamp\": \"2025-04-09 22:38:27,147\", \"level\": \"ERROR\", \"message\": \"Received None response from model\", \"article_text\": \"Josef Fritzl\\n\\nWhen Josef Fritzl applied for a permit to expand his basement in 1978, no one thought anything of it. Josef, a successful electrical engineer, was well known in the small Austrian village of Amstetten, where he was born and grew up. Everyone thought of him as an affable family man \\u2014 he and his wife, Rosemarie, had seven children.\\n\\nWhile some might have questioned how strict he was with his wife and children, the prevailing sentiment was, \\u201cif it\\u2019s not your business, stay out of it.\\u201d Only those close to the Fritzl family knew what a tyrant he truly was. He ruled the household with an iron fist, yelling at and beating the children for the slightest infraction. Rosemarie, too, was treated as one of Josef\\u2019s subjects, never allowed to have a say in anything, never given any money. If she didn\\u2019t obey his every command, she would be beaten. Josef often threatened to lock her in the house if she wasn\\u2019t obedient enough.\\n\\nYet it was his fourth child, Elisabeth, who seemed to bear the brunt of Josef\\u2019s abuse. He was extremely controlling of her, to the point of obsession. She was never allowed to have friends over or to do anything outside of his watchful eye \\u2014 he even took her with him everywhere he went. He would go through her things and read her diary. He would beat her for any reason, or sometimes, no reason at all.\\n\\nBeginning when she was about 11, Josef began exposing himself to Elisabeth and leaving porno magazines under her pillow. By the time she was 12, he began sexually abusing her.\\n\\nWith few friends outside of school, Elisabeth didn\\u2019t have anyone she could confide in. But her friends all say they knew the Fritzl home was not a good place to be, and that Elisabeth was deeply unhappy.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Josef was working tirelessly on his underground \\u201cbomb shelter\\u201d \\u2014 a labyrinth of tiny rooms connected by narrow passages. No one thought much of his project \\u2014 through the 70s and 80s, the Cold War was still on, and many Austrians still remembered the last time bombs had fallen on their cities.\\n\\nIn fact, Josef himself remembered the bombing of his hometown. He was only 3 years old when Hitler marched on Austria, and his father had put Josef on his shoulders so he could get a good look at the F\\u00fchrer. Little Josef was enamoured of Hitler, despite his mother being arrested by the Gestapo and sent to a concentration camp for three years.\\n\\nOnce she was back, now a single mother, she seemed to resent the burden of raising Josef. She was cold to him, showed him no affection, and left him alone for days and even weeks at a time. She beat him frequently. When the Allies bombed his city, his mother refused to take shelter, instead sending Josef alone to the air-raid shelters.\\n\\nSo Josef building a bomb shelter under his house seemed even more understandable than most. Concrete construction was his specialty, and of course he knew just how to safely install electrical systems. He hired a relative to help him with the construction tasks that he, a middle-aged man, couldn\\u2019t handle himself. Other than himself and the relative who helped him, no one was allowed in the basement, which he called \\u201chis kingdom.\\u201d\\n\\nBut there were certain details that didn\\u2019t make sense in a bomb shelter. Like that fact that the door to the shelter \\u2014 reinforced with concrete \\u2014 was hidden behind some rotating shelves straight out of a mystery movie. That door opened into essentially an airlock leading to yet another concrete-reinforced door. That inner door could only be opened with an electronic code, which only he knew, and could only locked or unlocked from the outside.\\n\\nIn early 1983, Josef was still working on his basement bunker, and Elisabeth was 16. It was then that she managed to escape her father\\u2019s abuse by running away with a friend to Vienna. However, since she was still a minor, police were able to take her into custody and return her to her parents.\\n\\nIn the car on the way back to their home, Josef told Elisabeth that he would never let her run away again.\\n\\nThe following year, after Elisabeth turned 18, she told her father that she had found a job and was going to move in with her older sister in a nearby town. But Josef was not going to allow her to escape from his control.\\n\\nOn Aug. 28, 1984, Josef lured her into his workshop to help him with a door. When Elisabeth entered the room, he came up behind her and chloroformed her. Once she was passed out, he handcuffed her and carried her down to his meticulously constructed basement. He chained her to a wall and left, locking her inside.\\n\\nHe then went to the police and played the distraught father to report her missing. Since Elisabeth had run away just the year before, many assumed she had simply done so again. But the police still investigated the young woman\\u2019s disappearance \\u2014 and if there was any foul play, her father would be the prime suspect.\\n\\nIn looking into Josef\\u2019s past, they found some troubling details. When he and Rosemarie had first married, he would stay out late at night, riding his bicycle around and \\u201cpeeping\\u201d at couples while they made out or had sex. He would expose himself to women on the street, and even masturbate in front of them. He attacked one woman in an attempt to rape her, but she was able to fight him off. Then, he followed another woman home from work. Later that night, when she was asleep, he broke into her house and raped her at knifepoint \\u2014 with her infant son asleep in a cot beside the bed.\\n\\nFor that crime, he had been sentenced to 18 months, but served just 12 months. Back at home, no one knew of this crime; ever-obedient Rosemarie told friends and family that he had gone away to work on a project for his company.\\n\\nAfter 15 years, the rape conviction was taken off his police record.\\n\\nNow Josef knew the police were starting to dig around and turn up things best kept buried. So, about a month after imprisoning her, he went down to the basement and forced Elisabeth to write a letter. In it she stated that she was alive and well, had joined a cult, and instructed them not to look for her. He drove 100 miles away to mail the letter, beginning what would become his double life.\\n\\nNow with the letter from Elisabeth, and with no other evidence to go on, her missing person case was closed. And Josef Fritzl was free to carry out his demented fantasies.\\n\\nElisabeth was kept chained to a wall in the dark, damp basement. Rats and insects infested the cave-like prison. Every couple of days, her father would come down and unchain her so he could rape and torture her. He would leave a little bit of food, just enough to last until the next time he came. If Elisabeth didn\\u2019t do as he told her, Josef warned, he would simply leave her there and let her starve to death.\\n\\nBy 1988, Elisabeth was pregnant with her father\\u2019s child. Josef gave her a medical book on childbirth, a towel, and some scissors, forcing her to give birth alone in the basement. Elisabeth named her newborn daughter Kerstin.\\n\\nIn 1990, she gave birth again, this time to a boy she named Stefan.\\n\\nIn 1992, she had another girl, this one named Lisa. But Lisa\\u2019s birth was different \\u2014 she was born with a heart defect. Her constant crying \\u2014 along with Elisabeth\\u2019s pleading for him to take her to see a doctor \\u2014 convinced Josef to find a way to get the baby out of the basement without raising suspicions. So he had Elisabeth write a letter stating that she couldn\\u2019t look after the baby. He then put 9-month-old Lisa into a cardboard box and left her on the doorstep for Rosemarie to find. They took Lisa to the hospital, where she underwent emergency surgery for her heart condition. Later Josef and Rosemarie would legally adopt Lisa.\\n\\nThat seemed to mark a turning point in the Fritzl home. While Josef had been living somewhat of a double life, going downstairs every day or so, sneaking food to his growing \\u201cdownstairs family,\\u201d now the double life was really taking off. He quit his job and went into business for himself, so his whereabouts wouldn\\u2019t be questioned by anyone. He would drive to towns miles away to drop off their trash and shop for diapers, food, and other supplies that people in Amstetten would question. He also began bringing in a TV, toys, radio, and other things to make the smelly, damp basement seem almost like a home.\\n\\nElisabeth, too, tried to make the children\\u2019s lives as normal as possible, keeping them on a schedule and teaching them to read and write.\\n\\nTwo years after Lisa\\u2019s birth, Elisabeth gave birth to another girl, Monica. This time, Josef made Elisabeth record a short message giving the baby up, then went to a pay phone, called his home, and played the recording when Rosemarie answered the phone. Then he left Monica on his doorstep and adopted her too.\\n\\nRealizing they needed more room, Josef put Elisabeth and the older children to work digging out soil with their bare hands. Eventually more rooms were created, expanding the basement to about 590 square feet.\\n\\nBut then in 1996, Elisabeth gave birth to twins, Alexander and Michael. Michael was having problems breathing right from the start. Ignoring Elisabeth\\u2019s pleas for him to take the baby to a hospital, Josef instead allowed Michael to die. He burned the tiny body in the furnace and scattered the ashes in his yard.\\n\\nAs for Alexander, Josef again forced Elisabeth to write a letter abandoning the baby, and again Josef and Rosemarie adopted this latest \\u201cfoundling.\\u201d\\n\\nIn 2002, she gave birth to the seventh of her children, Felix. Josef continued beating and raping Elisabeth in front of the children, but now he was torturing his \\u201cdownstairs family\\u201d in a new way. Besides his constant threats of abandoning them to starve, he would bring pictures of the three \\u201cupstairs\\u201d children to the basement with him. He would show the children \\u2014 who had lived their entire lives in a windowless basement \\u2014 pictures of their siblings playing outdoors in the sunlight, opening Christmas gifts, and taking gymnastics and music lessons.\\n\\nMeanwhile, aboveground, over 100 different lodgers came and went from the Fritzl house. All were forbidden from going into the yard above the basement, and especially forbidden from going into the basement at all. While some tenants reported hearing strange sounds, Josef was always able to explain them away.\\n\\nIn addition, social service caseworkers visited the Fritzl home 21 times to check on the well-being of the adopted \\u201cfoundlings.\\u201d None of them found anything suspicious, either.\\n\\nBut life in such a filthy, dark place could not continue forever. In April of 2008, Kerstin, now 19 years old, began having severe seizures and losing consciousness. Finally succumbing to Elisabeth\\u2019s pleas, Josef agreed to take her to a hospital. On April 18, Elisabeth helped carry her oldest daughter out of the basement \\u2014 then turned around and went back downstairs to her other two children.\\n\\nWhen Josef Fritzl brought his \\u201cgranddaughter\\u201d into the Mostviertel-Amstetten State Hospital, she was in grave condition. Her skin was so pale it was translucent; her teeth were all rotten. She was suffering from seizures, in and out of consciousness, and her kidneys and liver were shutting down. The doctors couldn\\u2019t tell what was causing all these symptoms, but they pointed to severe neglect.\\n\\nWhen questioned about what had happened to the young woman, Josef acted belligerent and angry, refusing to answer. He only wanted the doctors to fix Kerstin up and send her back home as quickly as possible.\\n\\nThen the hospital staff discovered something else that rang alarm bells: Kerstin Fritzl did not appear to exist. There was no record of her birth, no school records, no medical records, nothing. As Kerstin slipped into a coma, doctors knew they had to find her mother so that maybe she could shed light on what was happening.\\n\\nJosef claimed he had no idea where Elisabeth was; he said he found Kerstin dumped on his doorstep with a note like the others. So doctors and police went to the media, begging Elisabeth to come to the hospital and help them save her daughter.\\n\\nDown in the basement, Elisabeth saw the news reports that everyone was looking for her. Somehow she managed to convince her father to let her go to the hospital, promising she wouldn\\u2019t tell anyone where she really had been for the last 24 years. On April 26, 2008, Josef allowed Elisabeth to take Stefan and Felix out of the basement for the first time in their lives.\\n\\nWhen Elisabeth arrived at the hospital, she looked decades older than her 42 years. She was gaunt, pale, and her hair had gone entirely silver. The children were equally skinny and pale.\\n\\nSo police took Elisabeth in for questioning.\\n\\nAt first, she kept her promise to her father and said nothing of what had happened. But once she was told that she could be charged with being an accessory to a crime, she relented. Over the course of two hours, she told police of the living hell she had endured in that basement for the last 8,516 days.\\n\\nJosef Fritzl was arrested that day. He would be charged with multiple serious crimes, including rape, incest, slavery, kidnapping, and the murder of Michael.\\n\\nWord of the incredible story got out quickly, and media from all over the world descended on the small town of Amstetten. Only two years after the notorious case of Natascha Kampusch, such a similar and unspeakable crime in a relatively small country was big news.\\n\\nAfter Kerstin\\u2019s recovery, Elisabeth and all her children \\u2014 confirmed by DNA to be fathered by Josef \\u2014 were taken to a psychiatric clinic in Amstetten. The officer who drove the boys there described how Felix didn\\u2019t talk, just kept his nose pressed against the car window, fascinated by the world outside.\\n\\nThey would remain in the clinic for a year, receiving medical and psychiatric treatment and learning to adjust to life outside.\\n\\nJosef\\u2019s trial, which began March 16, 2009, was a sensation. Only 100 hand-picked journalists were allowed to attend. At first, Josef pled not guilty. His defense was that Elisabeth had been a wild, out-of-control teen, addicted to drugs and engaging in prostitution. He only locked her up, he said, to save her from such a destructive lifestyle.\\n\\nBut his court-ordered psychiatric evaluations disputed this. He told his therapist that he was \\u201cborn to rape,\\u201d and had locked his daughter up so that he didn\\u2019t go on and rape other women. He was diagnosed with \\u201csevere combined personality disorder\\u201d including borderline, schizotypal, and schizoid personalities.\\n\\nBefore trial, Elisabeth\\u2019s testimony \\u2014 over 11 hours long \\u2014 had been taped in order to protect her. When the tape was played, the torture she described at the hands of her father was so awful that some jurors couldn\\u2019t stand to watch for more than two hours at a time.\\n\\nJosef, who had been unemotional up to that point, broke down. He changed his plea to guilty, took responsibility for his crimes, and apologized to his family.\\n\\nHe was sentenced to the maximum allowed under Austrian law: life in prison. Once imprisoned, he had to be placed on suicide watch at first, and later he had to be segregated from the general prison population, as he was intensely hated and frequently attacked. At one point he changed his name to Josef Mayrhoff.\\n\\nAs of this writing, Josef is incarcerated in Garsten Abbey, suffering from Alzheimer\\u2019s and in failing health. If he lives long enough, he will be eligible for parole in 2024, when he would be 89.\\n\\nAs for Elisabeth and her children, they were given new identities and put up in a colorful house in a town known only as \\u201cVillage X.\\u201d They wish to remain out of the spotlight, so their home is equipped with surveillance cameras warning if anyone trespasses. Their neighbors also serve as a kind of guard, as well, warning off anyone who comes looking for them. Reports are that they are all doing very well, and that Elisabeth has even found love and gotten married.\\n\\nThe basement where she and her children spent so many years was, for a time, a kind of gruesome tourist attraction. But in 2013, the city of Amstetten had it filled with cement, forever sealing it closed.\", \"row_index\": 15605, \"stack_trace\": \"NoneType: None\\n\"}\n"

(And honestly, even in adulthood, I find oral is so much better than a long, hard, cylinder occasionally ramming into my cervix \\u2014 it\\u2019s a sensation I can do without.)\\n\\nSo one evening Sam and I begin fooling around under the covers of the lower portion of his bunk bed \\u2014 which is to say aggressively attacking each other faces with mouths, lips and tongues and grabbing at each other\\u2019s genitalia (over the clothes).

In the 1980s, Rio was the wealthiest public school in Sacramento, supported by a tax base generated from expansive California ranch houses and mutant versions of the English manor. Most of the kids who went to Rio were children of doctors, lawyers, and people high up in state politics. One of my friend\\u2019s father owned Sacramento\\u2019s biggest construction firm. Another acquaintance\\u2019s dad was dentist to governors and attorney generals.\\n\\nMe? I was one of the school runts, a kid from the other side of the river, lower middle class and falling. My dad lived in a workingman\\u2019s apartment on the edge of the district. I claimed his address so that I could go to Rio and play in its 5-watt radio station, the only reason I stayed in school. My immediate circle of school friends was four punk rockers \\u2014 O.C., Kitty, Mark O., and Percy. Deathryder served a year and was out. And there were some surfers, nerds, and new wavers with whom we punks were in friendly alliance.\\n\\nOur enemies were the same enemies all awkward, introspective kids have \\u2014 the jocks, the preppies, and the future frat boys \\u2014 let\\u2019s say the Brett Kavanaughs and Mark Judges of the world, the chummy, respectable, entitled moral-slobs that we battled every day. Stand in front of your locker, back to the hallway and you were sure to feel a shove when these creeps walked by. If you were a girl, that shove would come with a grope. The girl would scream and the boys being boys would laugh ha ha. If you were a nerd alone in the locker room, these are the guys who would trap you down and make you smell their balls. If you were a girl, especially if you were drunk, pinned to the ground, hand over your mouth, you got to experience their \\u201chorseplay.\\u201d\\n\\nO.C. and I learned early on that the way to keep the assholes from screwing with us was to screw with them. We did that by acting crazy, countering every taunt of \\u201cDevo punk rock faggot!\\u201d by screaming \\u201cI know where you live, I know where you sleep!\\u201d The one time I was jumped by jocks, I pulled hair, I bit, I clawed eyes, I punched their balls. I did not \\u201cfight fair\\u201d and they left me alone for the rest of my high school years. O.C. had much simpler solution, upon first threat, he swung his skateboard. Kitty also got into the crazy act, though her Soo Catwoman look already scared the shit out of the preps.\\n\\nBecause we were the school\\u2019s ultimate outsiders, we only had to deal with the school assholes when we were at school. We didn\\u2019t go to their parties or the five person drinking sessions held when mom and dad were away for the weekend. We didn\\u2019t go on their ski trips or European group vacations. We weren\\u2019t members of their country club. We escaped all the informal gatherings at which alleged predators like Kavanaugh and Judge looked for drunken prey. But, we knew all about them. Everybody did.\\n\\nBeing an outsider meant that I was confidant to girls who dealt with harassment and attacks. Come Monday, in science class, my lab partner \\u201cRebecca Munson\\u201d would recite the weekend\\u2019s crimes. \\u201cBrad Harrington\\u201d had pushed \\u201cSandy Roche\\u201d into a closet and groped her. \\u201cBarbara Hanson\\u201d got her top ripped off by \\u201cPhil Raymond\\u201d and \\u201cPeter Hughes\\u201d at a pool party. \\u201cJohn Klaus,\\u201d \\u201cBart Jenson,\\u201d and \\u201cSpaulding Stills\\u201d pulled a train on \\u201cCynthia Marlowe\\u201d while she was passed out. Rebecca\\u2019s recitation was hushed but a matter-of-fact, more resignation than condemnation, more reluctant acceptance than righteous anger. It was boys being boys.\\n\\nNone of this should surprise anyone who went to high school in the 1980s. Reagan\\u2019s America was an entitled jock running wild. Donald Trump rose to prominence in Reagan\\u2019s America. \\u201cPolitical correctness\\u201d didn\\u2019t exist \\u2014 women and people of color who objected to being called \\u201ccunt\\u201d or \\u201cnigger\\u201d either weren\\u2019t heard or silenced. LGBT people? Ha! Gay men were being slaughtered by AIDS while Reagan hid mum. \\u201cDate rape\\u201d wasn\\u2019t rape. It was boys being boys. Discussion of date or acquaintance rape was restricted to feminist circles. It wasn\\u2019t until the late 80s that the first major study on date rape occurred and then a decade or so for date rape to be seen the majority of Americans as rape.\\n\\nIf you don\\u2019t trust me, check out the culture. Privileged young men and their debauchery are stars of the Brat Pack novels. The misogyny of comedians Eddie Murphy and Andrew Dice Clay doesn\\u2019t age particularly well. Try watching Porky\\u2019s, the 80s in the 50s film about teenagers trying to get laid. Or Risky Business, in which Tom Cruise plays a wealthy high school pimp. Or Fast Times at Ridgemont High, about teenagers trying to get laid. Or Weird Science, featuring two teenage boys who create a woman so that they can get laid. Or Revenge of the Nerds, where we learn that if geeks act like jocks and preps, they can get laid too. There\\u2019s The Last American Virgin, Can\\u2019t Buy Me Love, hell, the 80s is littered with teen comedies that tell young men that the surefire way to get laid is through trickery and deceit, or, failing all else, date rape. Think I am exaggerating? Let\\u2019s look at two popular films from the era.\\n\\nFirst is John Hughes\\u2019 Sixteen Candles. Like most of Creepy John\\u2019s films, Sixteen Candles is about teenage high school students trying to get laid. The set up is pretty typical: Cute and somewhat awkward girl wants the attention of wealthy, handsome, popular boy, but Popular Boy doesn\\u2019t acknowledge Cute Girl. Cute Girl reluctantly befriends obnoxious, Virgin Geek, who is also trying to score \\u201cout of his league\\u201d \\u2014 Geek wants to get with Popular Boy\\u2019s beautiful, Popular Girlfriend. On the way to everyone getting what they desire, we bond characters by laughing at things like the racist humiliation of Asian exchange student \\u201cLong Duk Dong.\\u201d We finally get to the Big Party, where Popular Boy is disgusted by his girlfriend\\u2019s drunkenness. Popular Boy wants someone pure. He wants Cute Girl. To rid himself of soiled Popular Girl, he convinces packs her in to his Rolls Royce with Virgin Geek, telling her that Virgin Geek is him. Drunk, Popular Girl knows no better. Virgin Geek and Popular Girl wind up in a church parking lot. Virgin Geek fucks Popular Girl, who still thinks that she is with her boyfriend, Popular Boy. The next morning, Popular Girl wakes up next to Geek. She knows that something sexual has happened and that she was not fully conscious when it occurred. This is shared with the Geek. No one feels horror, shame, embarrassment, or regret. There are no apologies, for no one acknowledges that non-consensual sex has occurred. Rather, the date rape is played for laughs. It is a triumph for the young man, who now has won the affections of the woman he raped.\\n\\nNumber two offender is Animal House, a movie near and dear to former juvenile delinquents like me. Though Animal House \\u2014 a spoof on frat society in the 1960s \\u2014 was made in 1978 about, its influence on 1980s teen and screwball comedies is huge. Animal House is the first great melding of post-60s anti-authoritarianism, celebration for the outsider, and attacks on the elite with girl-crazy guy culture, teen rebellion, and midnight movie humor. The writing is sharp and funny and there\\u2019s brilliant performances. Bluto Blutarsky\\u2019s fight speech is one of the great comedy moments on film. Animal House also has a few problems, primarily the scene in which freshman college student Larry \\u201cPinto\\u201d Kruger is fooling around with the mayor\\u2019s daughter, drunken teenage Clorette DePasto.\\n\\nThe scene occurs during the toga party. Larry and Clorette are making out. Larry tries to unhook Clorette\\u2019s bra but can\\u2019t figure out how to do it. Clorette sits up to unhook it herself. As the bra comes off, she passes out. Larry looks at Clorette laying topless and unconscious on the bed. A flash of smoke and the Devil is at Larry\\u2019s shoulder, \\u201cFuck her. Fuck her brains out\\u2026You know she wants it.\\u201d With a shimmer and a pop, an effeminate angel appears on the opposite shoulder, \\u201cFor shame, Lawrence, I\\u2019m surprised at you.\\u201d The Devil playing obnoxious, the angel as prim sissy engage in comedic debate. Larry shrugs and looks to the angel. The Devil, disgusted, insults Larry, \\u201cYou homo!\\u201d and disappears in smoke.\\n\\nYes, Larry did the \\u201cright thing\\u201d by not raping Clorette. However, Larry\\u2019s \\u201cpredicament\\u201d wasn\\u2019t \\u201cto rape or not to rape,\\u201d but, whether to be a \\u201cmanly man\\u201d or a \\u201csissy boy.\\u201d He chose \\u201csissy boy,\\u201d so we get to laugh at the Devil calling Larry a \\u201cHomo.\\u201d Clorette\\u2019s vulnerability to rape is the set up for a lame fag joke. By playing date rape for a laugh, John Landis, Harold Ramis, and Doug Kenney present Clorette\\u2019s near rape as acceptable.\\n\\nAs bad as making a chucklefest of date rape is how the filmmakers frame Larry\\u2019s decision within the context of the film. The Devil and the angel are crude stereotypes of the disgustingly crude rebel and the annoyingly upright goody-goody. Divorced from the context of the whole film, the caricatures are no big deal. The Devil and the angel are equally obnoxious. If the tenor of the movie was that we all sit in a moral center where we constantly struggle between our impulses, gross Devil and prissy angel are just lazy illustrations of the pull of \\u201cgood and evil.\\u201d However, there is no moral center in Animal House. The main message of the film is that having fun by embracing disgustingly crude rebellion is a high (low) calling! Animal House\\u2019s heroes are the law-breakers, the villains are law & order. Delta House is the Devil. Dean Wormer is an angry angel. Larry\\u2019s decision to do the \\u201cright thing\\u201d goes against Delta House\\u2019s ethos.\\n\\nMy critique is not that of a humorless, \\u201cpolitically correct\\u201d academic. Animal House was one of the most influential films of my youth. I\\u2019ve watched it at least fifty times, most recently a few months ago. It is on my comedy Mt. Rushmore with The Jerk, Airplane, and Caddyshack. As a teenager, I memorized John Belushi\\u2019s dialogue. Deathryder and I used its pranks as inspiration. Its anti-authoritarianism influenced my anti-authoritarianism. But, fact is, one of the film\\u2019s central gags frames the debate over whether or not an unconscious woman should be raped as normal male behavior.\\n\\nWhen Animal House was released, there was a lot of fuss among preachers, teachers, and moralists about \\u201cthe message it sent to young people.\\u201d Few could abide by its attacks on authorities. Much was made about the film\\u2019s \\u201cgrossness\\u201d and \\u201ctoilet humor.\\u201d People debated whether the Bluto\\u2019s \\u201czit\\u201d joke was \\u201cappropriate\\u201d for youth. Prigs complained the film\\u2019s \\u201cEat Me\\u201d float encouraged mindless rebellion and disrespect for the military. At my junior high, the vice principal called a school assembly specifically to tell us that food fights would not be tolerated at Kit Carson Middle School. Not one word was said about date rape.\\n\\nBefore I go further, I want to make it clear that I am not a moral relativist. There is right and there is wrong. There are also grey areas, but those tend to be clear, too. Murdering another person is wrong. Killing someone who is trying to kill you is most definitely a moral grey area, though I\\u2019d say it\\u2019s acceptable self-defense. I do not believe that when something occurred has any bearing on what is moral or not. Right or wrong is constant.\\n\\nSlavery is wrong. It is wrong in the 2010s. It was wrong in the 1800s. It was wrong in the 1500s. It was wrong in the 1500 BCs. Though slavery is eternally wrong, for most of human history slavery was the norm. Normalcy is not morality. What is considered normal is not right or wrong. Normal is the \\u201cusual, typical, or expected.\\u201d\\n\\nIn the 1980s, date rape was normal. It was so normal that, as noted, what we now consider date rape wasn\\u2019t acknowledged as rape. Hell, it wasn\\u2019t acknowledged at all. It wasn\\u2019t talked about because no one, besides its victims and a handful of \\u201cextremists\\u201d thought it worthy of discussion. Date rape wasn\\u2019t rape. It was \\u201cboys being boys.\\u201d It was \\u201chorseplay.\\u201d It was \\u201cstealing home base.\\u201d It was \\u201cripping one off.\\u201d It was \\u201ctaking advantage.\\u201d It was \\u201cpulling a train.\\u201d It was anything but rape, and it was normal. It was not unusual. It was not atypical. And, among many drunk, entitled teenage boys, it was expected. Date rape was a male rite of passage. It was something to brag about in the locker room, as was \\u201cgrabbing her by the pussy.\\u201d\\n\\nDespite what liberals, conservatives, moralists, and good meaning people want you to believe, rape was normal male behavior. I gave you some examples in film of how rape was portrayed as just a thing guys do, just boys being boys. Let\\u2019s go way back in time: Ancient Greek myth celebrates rape in the story of Leda and the Swan. A controversial interpretation sure, but the Christian God\\u2019s impregnation of the Virgin Mary can be read as a celebrated act of rape.\\n\\nRock & roll? Pop? The Rolling Stones\\u2019 \\u201cBrown Sugar\\u201d is about raping a slave. Rod Stewart\\u2019s \\u201cTonight\\u2019s the Night\\u201d is about an older man coercing a teenage girl into sex. Devo\\u2019s \\u201cTriumph of the Will\\u201d is one of many \\u201cI know your \\u2018No\\u201d means \\u201cYes\\u201d\\u201d songs. George Michael\\u2019s \\u201cFather Figure\\u201d is an ode to pedophiliac rape. You\\u2019d think that as rock & roll and pop \\u201cmatured\\u201d artists would temper their enthusiasm for rape. You think wrong. Sublime\\u2019s \\u201cDate Rape\\u201d from 1992 explains that \\u201cif it wasn\\u2019t for date rape I\\u2019d never get laid.\\u201d Nine Inch Nail\\u2019s \\u201cCloser\\u201d (1994) is either a song about \\u201csexual frustration\\u201d or rape. And, over the last decade we\\u2019ve heard Chris Brown\\u2019s \\u201cBack to Sleep,\\u201d Robin Thicke\\u2019s \\u201cBlurred Lines,\\u201d Jamie Foxx\\u2019s \\u201cBlame it on the Alcohol,\\u201d and Justin Bieber\\u2019s \\u201cWhat Do You Mean?\\u201d Dive into hip hop, metal, and punk, we\\u2019ll come up with hundreds more.\\n\\nHell, in high school I joined a punk band who had a song written from a rapist\\u2019s point of view. It wasn\\u2019t a celebration of rape. It was more like horror movie shock, but, still, nobody, me included, considered the song out of the ordinary. We didn\\u2019t have a phrase for all this back then, but we do today. It is called rape culture.\\n\\nWhen boys and girls are raised thinking date rape is not rape but something so normal that it is celebrated in culture, normal boys like Brett Kavanaugh will (allegedly) rape. The victims will stay silent for years because deep in the victim\\u2019s subconscious is the idea that what happened is normal and, for many people, especially young people, what is normality and morality is confused. Subconsciously, what is perceived as normal is also seen as \\u201cright.\\u201d It takes a person years and much self-work to sort all of this out, especially when the sorting is done in a culture which tells us that a victim shouldn\\u2019t have dressed a certain way or was somehow responsible for their rape.\\n\\nWhen someone says or implies that Kavanaugh and Judge\\u2019s alleged attack on Christine Blasey Ford was \\u201cboys being boys,\\u201d when placed in context, in the 1980s, \\u201cboys being boys\\u201d is true. Boys being boys attacked a girl. People who say, \\u201cThat didn\\u2019t happen at my high school!\\u201d are blind to what was going on then or are liars now. Rape happened at your high school. Your peers were both the rapists and the victims.\\n\\nRacism happened at your high school. The two Black girls, the Mexican boy, and the twelve Asian kids that you went to school with were harassed and attacked for their race and ethnicity. Homophobia happened at your high school. Name me one openly gay kid at school in the 1980s. Name me one closeted gay kid who did not live in terror of being found out. Misogyny? Ask the girls who slut-shamed for having sex or being raped. All this happened at your high school. And most of us were silent because we were confused, we didn\\u2019t know right and wrong from what was perceived as normal, we didn\\u2019t know how to act on what we knew was wrong, or we were too scared to go against our peers and act. All that happened. You know it. I know it. So, let\\u2019s drop the charade and admit that in the 1980s (and beyond) boys got away with date rape because it was considered normal.\\n\\nOnly by accepting that boys and girls were raised in a culture that did not acknowledge date rape as rape and accepted it as normal male behavior, can we change things. When we hear \\u201cboys will be boys,\\u201d we know exactly where this defense is coming from. When the boys will be boys club concocts incoherent theories deflecting blame and defending date rape we know what era normalcy is being based on. We are not just battling the present, but also the past. We aren\\u2019t just fighting for Blasey Ford\\u2019s right to speak up, but we are taking on a culture.\\n\\nWhite people spent much of the past decade living under the lie that we lived in a \\u201cpost-racial\\u201d world. We had a Black president, so everything was \\u201cebony and ivory.\\u201d We were fools. Men and some women fuming that \\u201cThis wasn\\u2019t my high school\\u201d and \\u201cNotAllMen\\u201d are, again, playing the fool. They are more concerned with self-appearance and parsing words than dealing with real world problem of rape and misogyny. We cannot be sucked into petty arguments over language, otherwise we are playing whack-a-mole with symptoms. We squash \\u201cboys will be boys\\u201d and now have to deal with \\u201chorseplay\\u201d or \\u201crough sex\\u201d or whatever lame ass thing comes out in defense of Kavanaugh and others. Forget that, let\\u2019s get to the disease and root it out.\\n\\nThis essay originally appeared in the September 19th issue of Soriano\\u2019s Comment, \\u211624.

A lot of us, even in the LGBTQ+ community, grew up in church. But I feel like that is a gross oversimplification of what being part of the church was to my family at the time. We were at church Sunday morning, Sunday evening, Monday night, Wednesday night, and for a good chunk of the year during Upward basketball season Saturday too. Four out of seven days of the week I was in church. It didn\\u2019t matter, if the church had something going on our family would be there. From worship services, to potlucks, to plays, to youth parties, to camps, to basketball, to revivals and concerts and everything in between being at this church was our life. We didn\\u2019t even live close to this church. But being at church, and driving 30 minutes each way just had to be done, Jesus was at work there was what we were told.\\n\\nBut in the midst of it all, Faith Baptist Church was doing the unthinkable and horrid atrocity that can be done. The church was employing a man that was abusing and molesting children, Clyde Way, who now resides in Albermarle, NC and is on the national sex registry served as Youth Pastor at Faith until 2005. Not only were they hiding a pedophile that was abusing children, they were then running Celebrate Recovery groups that combated addictions such as homosexuality and \\u201cgender-confusion\\u201d too.\\n\\nFirst, Clyde Way, this man abused way more people that just the children he was arrested for in North Carolina at Fort Caswell. His antics were known all through Faith yet nothing was ever done. He was the only adult leader that didn\\u2019t bunk with other adult men. He usually would bunk with 2\\u20133 \\u201cat-risk\\u201d teens to help mentor them. I will never forget what I saw at Centrifuge in 2003, and what I should I have reported then at North Greenville College, but sexual trauma causes many of us to be frozen with fear, and we also have a fear of seeing the abuser again.\\n\\nI was not out in high school. For various reason, one of which was the church I grew up in, two was there were no tools for me to explain it to my parents. Transgender people were still relegated to Maury Show episodes titled Is it a Man or Is it a Woman?. I was terrified of coming out in the early 2000s as a kid, so I hid. This night in 2003 would also remind me why I hid, because the church I attended was disgusting and the abuse would only be worse.\\n\\nIt was the third night of the camp. At this point pranks usually were at the highest, and two kids tried to break into my brother and I\\u2019s room and steal our stuff. So we sprayed sunscreen in their eyes, and were reprimanded by Way for not understanding \\u201cfun\\u201d and would have to miss free time and stay with him that night. The two kids were two of his favorite boys. Nothing was mentioned at the fact they had threatened to physically harm my brother and I. No, we were the problem, because we fought back. That night we had to spend with Way in his room, and a couple of other kids. One of the kids was a student that didn\\u2019t want to use the showers without having his swimsuit on. A smart idea for public showers among multiple other kids from other states that you have never met. However, this was also apparently a problem for Way. Way liked to walk from his room to the showers and back nude saying how great it was to be naked. He would also get in the shower, and shower next to us minors naked and show us how he was scrubbing his body, and say, looks it\\u2019s fine, just get naked and shower with me. But this night he took it even further.\\n\\nWe were sitting in his room, and of course as the night went on we shared some sodas together as a small group, and even played some card games. Now there were some younger middle schoolers there and Clyde Way decided well it\\u2019s late enough to talk about that, that being puberty. He said I know some of you are afraid to shower naked here at camp, and it\\u2019s probably because your bodies are changing. At this he begins to take off his shirt.\\n\\nHe goes on about how chest hair is normal and you need to start using deodorant. Then it gets sicker. He starts taking off his pants. As we are sitting there he says, you also start to have changes down here pulling his boxers waistband away from his body and then he sits there with just his boxers on. He then gets up and comes closer to one of the boys, and starts to pull his boxers down, he starts showing us all his pubic hair, saying this is what a man\\u2019s dick will grow. He then says we can reach out and touch him if we want. At this I jump up, and run from the room. I don\\u2019t know what happened the rest of the night. But I do know a youth pastor asked and had young men feel his genitals and he asked me to after showing them to me and the others in the room.\\n\\nI stopped wanting to be a part of youth group after that. All I could think was this man wants to have sexual encounters with children, and my church thinks LGBTQ+ people are the problem.\\n\\nI told my parents I didn\\u2019t want to be part of youth group anymore because it wasn\\u2019t theologically deep enough. Honestly, I didn\\u2019t want to be part of the youth group because I had experienced sexual assault from the man that was supposed to help me not be trans, and be a man. I was terrified what could happen if I was in the same room with that man. Since I had told him about my trans identity what would he do? Would he make me dress up and act like a girl? I had no clue, I just needed to be away from him.\\n\\nA few months later Clyde Way announced he was retiring from ministry in the fall of 2004. The church celebrated his decades of service to the church. Old youth group members now \\u201cmissionaries\\u201d came back and told about how amazing he was and how they had inspired them in their journey. I wanted to ask but what else did he tell you and make you do? They played slide shows of the hero of the Navy turned saver of souls. They had a potluck dinner and party to send him off. Everyone was supposed to give a monetary gift and wish him well. I remember feeling sick at being forced to attend these events and seeing this man celebrated.\\n\\nI wasn\\u2019t the only kid to experience this. Tons of other kids talked about Way going to middle school camp and asking kids if they wanted to watch him masturbate or to masturbate with him to learn techniques to \\u201ccum.\\u201d He would then lead a True Loves Wait rally later in the year after talking about the dangers of porn and masturbation. Other kids told me, and told other adults about Clyde Way and his perverted behavior. Way had a group of adults that surrounded him like a mafia don. If he did anything weird it was just Clyde acting like the youth, which makes him a good pastor for them. The church\\u2019s response when others reported him was throw a retirement party. Faith Baptist Church never did a thing to stop him. They sent a pedophile to North Carolina where he has preyed upon other kids with a wallet of bonus money and left over cakes.\\n\\nBut the hate and ignorance doesn\\u2019t end there. Dr. Clarence Byerly, although not a medical doctor, or biologist at all, decided to champion the churches anti-transgender charge writing a piece called Potty Politics which I don\\u2019t suggest you read.\\n\\nIn this random jumbled piece the \\u201ceducation\\u201d pastor talks about being bullied as a kid in the bathroom, and wishing women could have come in with him as an introduction that leads to finally saying \\u201cThe government is heavy-handedly forcing everyone to not discriminate on the basis of gender, declaring that anyone can use any restroom.\\u201d So I mean he starts off saying he wishes women could come into men\\u2019s bathrooms, but then saying he is upset anyone can use any bathroom? Also, this piece is coming from a man that worked with Clyde Way that entered men\\u2019s restrooms to molest and prey on kids in his own church and at church sanctioned events that he helped hide and cover up. He is also really mad that \\u201cwe will have to start asking people what their preferred gender pronoun is so no one will feel discriminated against\\u201d because he was once bullied so now he wants to bully trans people. He goes on to say he actually fears the direction of his own church because \\u201cOur church is now marketing the \\u201cWe Are For\\u201d slogan all over our neighborhoods, so that we are becoming known as being for the \\u2018gender-confused.\\u2019 \\u201d So his church is marketing that they are \\u201cfor\\u201d people, but being welcoming and inclusive to people isn\\u2019t cool with him? He rather they would be known for discrimination, intolerance, hate and child molestation I guess? Solid piece, we get it you hate trans people, and don\\u2019t want them at your church. Guess what, we don\\u2019t want to be there either. But why write this random and rambling piece?\\n\\nNow Clarence here is also, or was, the contact person for Faith Baptist Church hosting Celebrate Recovery. Knowing that makes a lot more sense about why he was so angry about transgender people. He closes his little tirade with reasons and ways to disagree, confront and change the \\u201cgender-confused\\u201d. Well these tactics were in play at the church when I was there, and after because they hosted this Celebrate Recovery program that is also a conversion therapy and drug rehabilitation service. Faith Baptist church was using their funding to sponsor therapists to use their location and carry out \\u201cChristian\\u201d therapy for those that were \\u201cgender-confused\\u201d \\u201csexuality-confused\\u201d or \\u201caddicted\\u201d. The everyday church member didn\\u2019t even know these counselors were on site, but I remember hearing youth leaders talk about recommending parents of queer kids be referred to them. Celebrate Recovery met every Sunday from 6\\u20138pm, and they even had special events during Sunday night services where people would stand before us and tell us they had become \\u201cfree of their chains or struggles\\u201d. As a kid I didn\\u2019t realize it, but I was watching poor souls paraded in front of me as healed of homosexuality because they had been a part of the churches abusive conversion therapy programs.\\n\\nSo Byerly writes his piece telling the church they must confront these issues no matter how \\u201cdisgusting\\u201d they are. At the end of the day he finds trans people disgusting, but being friends with, and covering up child molestation is the Lord\\u2019s work.\\n\\nThis church has a history of abuse, and hate. I was a victim of sexual abuse, and still see many of these same men leading a church when they have crimes on their own hands.\\n\\nAt 33 I can now say that the church I grew up in, and that still meets is a hate group, and a church that houses sexual abuse. Many of the staff are still there that helped hide the things Clyde Way did every single day he was employed there. Before even going to camp I remember Clyde Way telling parents that he would help their sons get use to showering with other men, and that he walked around naked to make us all feel comfortable. How is that okay? How can you support that?\\n\\nWhen I first spoke out about the things Clyde Way did while I attended my comments were removed from the church\\u2019s social media page, and reviews. I\\u2019ve been told by one of their current pastors Jeff Higgins, \\u201cmy family is trash\\u201d on social media, and was threatened repeatedly by his wife. In a recent broadcast I was told the senior pastor joked about Higgins epic social media takedowns. Yep, the more things change, the more they stay the same. Faith is a closed knit group of discriminatory and predatory individuals. In an era where we are naming evils I am naming the years of abuse I was forced to endure under their pastoral staff. I know others have been as well. I would just ask you to come forward, you don\\u2019t even have to be named.\\n\\nUnfortunately my case won\\u2019t be heard because Maryland for another year in a row rejected the Hidden Predator Act that would remove limitation of reporting sexual assault. I\\u2019ve suffered with this image and abuse for years. If you have experienced this at Faith, or any church, you can speak out, hold this church and these churches accountable. Way was sentenced to 58 days in jail for his sexual assault in North Carolina and three years of probation that expired in 2018. He is living free in North Carolina when he should have served almost 19 years in jail. He has ruined more than 19 years and 58 days for many of us that grew up in churches and camps he attended.\\n\\nAs Faith continues forward with new paint, and glossy new marketing about what they are for, dark demons prowl it\\u2019s halls, and the evils they did will follow many of us until we die. They may be a church that is \\u201cfor\\u201d a lot of things, all I will remember is they are \\u201cfor\\u201d hiding sexual abuse and bigotry.\", \"row_index\": 19944, \"stack_trace\": \"NoneType: None\\n\"}\n"

      "{\"timestamp\": \"2025-04-09 23:29:26,619\", \"level\": \"ERROR\", \"message\": \"Received None response from model\", \"article_text\": \"I didn\\u2019t find out I was a middle until I was in my mid-30s. And then I felt like I had to figure everything out on my own.\\n\\nMy first hunch was that I was drawn to so many elements of the Daddy Dom, little girl kink.\\n\\nI love the dynamic created in DDlg relationships. And I adore the aesthetic that goes with it \\u2014 everything cutesy, playful, and bubbly.\\n\\nAnd of course, I\\u2019m really into the daddy doms. The way they can be dominant, nurturing, and giving all at once makes me weak in the knees.\\n\\nBut I could never fully identify with the littles I found online. The more I read up on their lifestyles and saw what being a little means in practice, the less it felt like my kink.\\n\\nI could get down with being playful and sweet, but I wasn\\u2019t into the idea of putting a pacifier or a sippy cup to my mouth.\\n\\nSame with a lot of the activities littles use to get in their favorite headspace. I don\\u2019t mind cuddling a stuffed toy or playing with a squishy one, but I don\\u2019t really care to color with crayons or watch cartoons and Disney movies.\\n\\nIt was the same with sex. Some of my favorite porn is heavy with DDlg themes and a lot of my recurring fantasies involve being younger and a whole lot more innocent than I really am. But not so young that I want to dress in a onesie and baby talk my way through a fuck.\\n\\nEventually, I came across the concept of a middle and it gave me so much clarity.\\n\\nLittles feel comfortable, relaxed, and happy when they get in a headspace that\\u2019s reminiscent of being a child. Middles, though, feel that same way when they can get in a headspace that reminds them of being a teenager.\\n\\nAnd that was it. That\\u2019s why I felt like an impostor as an adult but I still didn\\u2019t feel comfortable sitting at the little kids\\u2019 table.\\n\\nAs a middle, I was in between those two states. I\\u2019m at my happiest when I feel like I\\u2019m seventeen again (specifically, seventeen and three quarters).\\n\\nI finally felt like I had found my place, my label, and one of the most significant parts of my identity \\u2014 and then I felt alone again.\\n\\nI could find loads of information about littles, activities to help you get into little space, and even some very clear indications of what sex as a little could look like.\\n\\nBut not much for middles.\\n\\nWhen I did find something, it was clear that the middles who wrote them were closer to being tweens at heart instead of women who wanted to feel like they did when they were on the cusp of adulthood. A lot of the advice I got from them was still way too childlike for my particular kink.\\n\\nI started to feel adrift and a bit helpless. I had just unearthed this side of myself and had no idea how to fully embrace it. I couldn\\u2019t find advice that told me exactly what to do so I could spend more time in middlespace.\\n\\nMostly, I found other middles asking the same questions I had and not getting a whole lot of answers.\\n\\nThen I realized that I didn\\u2019t actually need as much help as I thought I did. The more I looked at my life, my habits, and my hobbies through the middle lens, the more I saw that I had been doing things to put myself in middlespace for years. I just didn\\u2019t know why I was doing them.\\n\\nI put this list together for other middles who are trying to find their way (and for the daddy doms trying to give their middles what they need). These are the kinds of things I do to get into my teen mindset and step into the happy comfort of my middlespace.\\n\\nBe Cute and Expressive With Your Makeup\\n\\nThere\\u2019s the way I do my makeup when I want to look understated. It\\u2019s what I wear when I don\\u2019t want to draw too much attention and look like what people expect a lady in her thirties to look like.\\n\\nThen there\\u2019s the way I do my makeup when I want to feel good in my skin.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s not the way I did it when I was actually seventeen \\u2014 I didn\\u2019t have YouTube tutorials and I had no clue what I was doing. But it\\u2019s deliberately cute. It feels youthful, bright, and flashy.\\n\\nIf you want to get in middlespace, it helps to look the part. So, consider drawing on some freckles. Apply some long fake lashes. Dab some blush on your nose and the apples of your cheeks.\\n\\nUse some of the brightest eyeshadow you own. Get some bold lipstick colors.\\n\\nForget some of the makeup rules you follow when you\\u2019re in your boring grown-up mode. There\\u2019s no room for subtlety when you\\u2019re trying to get in the middle mindset.\\n\\nExperiment With Hairstyles\\n\\nBraids, pigtails, and space buns are perfect hair styling options for a middle look. You can also play up your bangs and give yourself doll curls.\\n\\nWearing colorful headbands, scrunchies, and making liberal use of cute hair clips works well, too.\\n\\nDye your hair in bright fantasy colors. I used to do this a lot when I was in my twenties. I would try out natural hair colors but they never felt like me. I would always go back to something bright and it felt like a huge relief every time. Now, I\\u2019ve settled on purple and it helps me feel like myself when I look in the mirror.\\n\\nIf you don\\u2019t want to dye your hair \\u2014 or you love playing around with your looks too much \\u2014 you can also get a set of cute wigs. That way, you can switch between a pastel pink bob or long bright blue strands on a whim.\\n\\nDress Up Cute as a Button\\n\\nStock your closet with all sorts of cute outfits.\\n\\nWear poofy dresses fit for a princess. Find a way to match a tutu with the rest of your outfit. Slip on your plaid miniskirt and put together a schoolgirl look.\\n\\nDepending on your personal style, you could dress up like an e-girl, put together some pastel goth outfits, or wear oversized shirts like a VSCO girl.\\n\\nAgain, it doesn\\u2019t have to be the kinds of things you wore when you were a teenager. It just has to put you in a youthful mindset and match the way you feel deep down inside.\\n\\nTurn Your Bedroom Into a Middle Sanctuary\\n\\nMake your bedroom into a space that you can escape into and feel like yourself.\\n\\nString up twinkle lights everywhere. Cover the wall in posters. Stack stuffies on your dresser and stick polaroids into the edges of your mirror. Get a canopy bed and throw soft fuzzy pillows and cushions on it.\\n\\nDo as much or as little as you want. If you want it to look like a Claire\\u2019s or a Hot Topic threw up in your bedroom, go for it.\\n\\nPart of me would love to turn the volume way up and make my room a bright, bubblegum sanctuary. But I hold back because there are two competing styles that I love surrounding myself with.\\n\\nI\\u2019m into very minimalistic decor with lots of whites, greys, and wood grain. But the middle in me wants everything jam packed with adorableness.\\n\\nThe result is a dark wood stain canopy bed wrapped in artificial vines and strewn with twinkle lights. It makes me feel like I\\u2019ve created a teenage love nest and just sitting in it helps me fall into the middle mindset.\\n\\nWatch Teen Movies\\n\\nWatching movies aimed at teens is a great way to get in a middle mood.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s especially effective if you watch the types of movies that were formative for you during your teen years.\\n\\nFor you, it might be teen slashers like Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer. Or it could be high school comedies like Clueless or Mean Girls.\\n\\nFor me, it was teen dramas that focused on sex. I love revisiting them or watching movies with the same themes. My absolute favorite is Cruel Intentions. It gave me so many sexual awakenings and watching it transports me back to that period in my life faster than anything can.\\n\\nYou can also get in your middle mindset by reading YA novels or watching teen TV shows. I was already in my twenties when Vampire Diaries started airing, but binge-watching a few episodes is a great way to get me some middle comfort.\\n\\nEmbrace Cute Over Sexy\\n\\nI\\u2019ve always struggled with lingerie. It never felt right on me. And I think that\\u2019s because I was trying too hard to be sexy when what I really wanted to be was cute.\\n\\nSome middles can definitely pull off sexy, don\\u2019t get me wrong. But a lot of us would rather express our sexuality in a way that feels more sweet and innocent.\\n\\nLean into that cuteness when you\\u2019re dressing up to have sex or to seduce your partner.\\n\\nMy first real sexy outfit was a fuckable Alice in Wonderland one. And I keep coming back to the thought of being a sexy Little Bo Peep someday. I\\u2019ve also got a schoolgirl outfit in the works.\\n\\nYou can also cosplay as whatever character makes you feel hot.\\n\\nThere are a lot of ways to be adorable, cute, and sweet while turning on your partner. Just embrace it, lean into it, and realize that you\\u2019re incredibly attractive when you do.\\n\\nGet in the Right Mindset During Sex\\n\\nMiddle space isn\\u2019t always a sexual thing, but it can be.\\n\\nIt very much is for me. One of the reasons I loved being seventeen so much is that I was flushed with so many horny hormones that everything felt exciting.\\n\\nYou can channel your middleness when you\\u2019re flirting or fucking by acting shy and naive. Play up your innocence and act fascinated by every part of sex and eager to learn more. Explore your partner\\u2019s body the way you would if you were extremely curious but highly inexperienced.\\n\\nDepending on the kind of middle you are, you can let yourself be bubbly an giggly while your daddy dom leads you through every sex act.\\n\\nIf you\\u2019re the bratty type, you can be a little defiant. Tease your partner and challenge them. Make them chase you before you give up the goods. Do what it takes to earn a really good spanking.\\n\\nNo matter what you do, keep your attitude and behavior playful and you won\\u2019t have to step out of your middle mindset.\\n\\nRoleplay Experience Gaps\\n\\nYou can\\u2019t undo your sexual experience, but you can roleplay not having it.\\n\\nYou and your partner can pretend to be teenagers on a first date that ends in dry humping and an impulsive fuck.\\n\\nYou can pretend it\\u2019s prom night and you\\u2019re finally going to lose your virginity.\\n\\nYou can just pretend that it\\u2019s the first time a boy is touching you and everything feels incredible and amazing.\\n\\nBut the scenarios that I find work best are the ones with a clear experience gap.\\n\\nThat can be your daddy dom opening you to a whole new world of sexual experiences.\\n\\nHe can pretend to be your dirty step uncle walking you through how to give a blowjob.\\n\\nOr you can roleplay being the bratty babysitter who got caught masturbating by the man of the house \\u2014 and you\\u2019ll do anything to keep him from telling anyone.\\n\\nYou can act out those roles explicitly if you can get into it without feeling too silly. Or you can just fantasize about them while getting down, which works surprisingly well.\\n\\nHelp Your Daddy Get into His Role\\n\\nYou\\u2019ll go way deeper in middle space if your daddy plays along and doms you just right. So, take some steps to get him excited and eager to treat you like the middle you are.\\n\\nThat can mean sharing fantasies, telling him what you like to do and enlisting his help, or having big conversations about the kind of dynamic you want to create in your relationship.\\n\\nYou can send him erotica that has some DDlg vibes. You can dig into some niche ebooks or even just get him to read Fifty Shades of Grey because it\\u2019s about a virgin discovering sex and kink for the first time.\\n\\nIf you really want to get him going, watch porn with him that has the right kind of scenarios and dynamics. I find that looking for babysitter porn is usually the best way to find the right mix of innocence, experience gap, and dominant authority.\\n\\nRecapture Your Teens\\n\\nBeing seventeen was an incredible time for me in so many ways\\n\\nIt\\u2019s when I really felt like I could be myself and let my personality shine\\n\\nIt\\u2019s when I discovered what it was like to be in love\\n\\nIt\\u2019s when I found out that sex wasn\\u2019t just fascinating or appealing \\u2014 it could also feel fucking incredible.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s when I was on the verge of adulthood and my future looked so shiny, sexy, and carefree.\\n\\nAnd because I never fully felt safe at home, being able to leave, stay out all night, and do more or less what I wanted was the first time I could actually put my guard down and feel comfortable.\\n\\nI can never go back to that. I have too many responsibilities, too much awareness, and not enough free time to just wander around the mall gossipping with other aimless ragamuffins.\\n\\nBut it doesn\\u2019t matter. I can\\u2019t be seventeen anymore but I don\\u2019t have to give up on the headspace I was in at that age. I can get back into it whenever I need to. All it takes are some bright colors, some escapist YA fantasies, and a partner who can earn the right to be called daddy.\", \"row_index\": 26048, \"stack_trace\": \"NoneType: None\\n\"}\n"

She goes down on you and maybe you go down on her too. Afterward she rushes into the bathroom crying, repeatedly wiping her tongue, washing her mouth. She is upset, and twelve \\u2014 older than you \\u2014 so you think you should be upset too. You never talk about it.\\n\\n1995.\\n\\nYou sit at the top of the stairs with your friend, Roman, and watch your parents\\u2019 friends watch porn in the basement. You like it, but you just watch. Later that year you become friends with Anya and you watch more porn and touch each other. You think she is ugly, but you like doing this anyway. One day you want it so bad you do it in the living room with her grandmother in the kitchen. You hang two aprons in the doorway between the rooms to try and keep her out. It seems to work.\\n\\n1996.\\n\\nThere are other girl friends you do this with. How many? Do you do it with Emily? With Liz? Britni? You and Alanna watch your dad\\u2019s porn and touch yourselves, but you never touch each other. There is one porn that you particularly like called The Erotic Adventures of Marco Polo. The first scene, the one that really did it for you, was a queen with her ladies-in-waiting serving her. You become obsessed with masturbating. You try and watch porn on the TV in your bedroom, but those channels don\\u2019t come in.\\n\\nSometimes at night on channel 1, though the screen is full of gray and white lines, you can make out the shapes of bodies and you can hear moans. And this is enough. You stick different things inside of you \\u2014 the remote control especially \\u2014 which has a rounded bottom. You feel guilty later and worry your parents will touch the remote and somehow find out. You promise yourself not to do it, but you break your promises.\\n\\n1997.\\n\\nYou meet Nora, who becomes your best friend. One night on the dark floor of her bedroom, while another friend sleeps in the bed, Nora slips her hand over to your thigh and into your underwear. She massages your clit for a long time and after a while your body convulses and shivers, and you feel a release you\\u2019ve never felt before. It is like a fistful of rubber bands twisted together, snapping loose all at once. She shows you how to make her shiver like that too. You do this together for years, but you never look at each other while you do it. Eventually you kiss her breasts, put them in your mouth. You want to do this often, and you do.\\n\\n1998.\\n\\nYou make yourself come all the time. You can lie in bed and do it 12 times in a row. You talk to your cousin about how much you love to masturbate. When she\\u2019s in the shower one summer day, you read her diary. She writes about how gross you are for doing it all the time, and especially for talking about it.\\n\\n1999.\\n\\nYou go to parties at a friend\\u2019s house. Her mom, Fran, lets anything happen there. Boys and girls sleep over together, and in the basement boys get blowjobs from different girls. Nick asks you to do it and you do, but only for a little bit. He smells good, like candy, but shoves himself into your mouth too hard making you gag. Later that night he gets a blowjob from another girl and you feel hurt and jealous.\\n\\n2000.\\n\\nYou start high school, and you wear a lot of zebra prints. You have a plush zebra print bedspread, a zebra print skirt with a fringe that bounces when you walk, and a zebra print purse. You somehow meet Sam, who is much older and dropped out of high school, and who says he will kill himself one day. You care for him, and want to make him ok.\\n\\nYou talk all night, get off the phone in the morning and go to school. One night when you are talking he decides to come over, to talk in person. You sit together in the cool night air. Eventually, and you don\\u2019t quite know how this happened, you have anal sex on the back porch of your parents\\u2019 house. You can\\u2019t remember if it hurt or where he came or much about it except your repeated prayers that your mother wouldn\\u2019t wake up and come to the kitchen for a glass of water or a sleeping pill, look out the screen doors and find you on your knees like this.\\n\\nYou still consider yourself a virgin. There are other boys: the one you give a hand job to in the movie theater, the one you go to homecoming with, make out with, go down on, whatever. They blur together. You don\\u2019t realize this until later, but you don\\u2019t remember ever being turned on with these boys. You\\u2019re just moving your hands or your mouth the way you\\u2019re supposed to, rushing through it so it would come to its inevitable end.\\n\\n2001.\\n\\nAt one sleep over, an older boy who you have never spoken to reaches over in the middle of the night and puts his hands in your pants. You freeze. He guides your hand into his pants and you stroke until he\\u2019s done. You do it mechanically, your back to him. In the morning you go home and take a long shower where you bleed and bleed and bleed. After this your period doesn\\u2019t come on its own anymore.\\n\\nYour mother\\u2019s gynecologist says you have to take birth control pills and you do for seven years. The older boy\\u2019s girlfriend, or ex-girlfriend, finds out about what happened, and she comes for you. She pulls your hair and slaps you in the front hallway of your school. You can\\u2019t remember what happens next. Did you punch her? Why didn\\u2019t either of you get in trouble? For the rest of the year, she and her friends spit on you, call you trash. One day a teacher approaches you asking why it says you\\u2019re a slut in the girls\\u2019 bathroom.\\n\\nLater that year, a friend of yours tries to slip his hand in your pants. You freeze like all the other times, but you are friends so it feels a little more possible to utter the word you want to say: no. He gets mad at you, says it\\u2019s unfair, you did it with other guys. You change most of your friends, change your style \\u2014 no more zebra print. Instead there are flowing skirts, no more make-up, your hair frizzy. Your mother is very concerned. She thinks you look ugly and sad.\\n\\n2002.\\n\\nYou get a boyfriend, Ryan. You have what you call real sex. Sex with him is like a bath just a few degrees colder than you would like it. It\\u2019s pleasant but not particularly satisfying. You\\u2019re comfortable enough with Ryan to lay beside him and get yourself off. You were always good at that, the rubber bands snapping loose like Nora taught you. You and Nora stop doing that thing that you don\\u2019t consider sex. She writes you a letter. She says what you two did for all those years made her worry that she might be gay. Somehow the thought had never occurred to you.\\n\\n2004.\\n\\nYou get another boyfriend, Tom, and it\\u2019s the same as Ryan, a lukewarm bath. Though you learn that you like wielding your power in sex, his cock in your control, you decide if he comes and when. Once you videotape yourselves having sex and you like that. You and your future partner watch it regularly until the computer it\\u2019s on gets stolen.\\n\\n2007.\\n\\nYou move to New York. You have lots of sex with different people. It\\u2019s sometimes fun, but often drunk and a few times you can\\u2019t remember it at all. You do remember Jessica, though, whose soft lips you kissed on the dance floor, her thigh pushed up between your legs, making you wet.\\n\\n2009.\\n\\nWhen you have sex with Kevin, who you meet in Montreal, you keep asking him if he\\u2019s going to come. He asks you why you are in such a hurry. You realize most of your sex has been like this, waiting for these guys to finish so you can be done.\\n\\n2011.\\n\\nRae. You\\u2019re obsessed with her voice and the massages she gives, which make you remember things you haven\\u2019t thought of since they happened. You go to concerts together, you smile a lot, squeezing each others\\u2019 thighs and hands. You sing together and her lips are so soft and smooth. She asks, are you bisexual? before you ever kiss.\\n\\nYou laugh and say you don\\u2019t like that word, but yes. She smiles, relieved. How many straight girls have broken her heart? She fingers you in bed, on the couch, in the car. She fucks you with a strap-on. You fuck her with the strap-on. You realize you like to be the one with the cock too.\\n\\n2012.\\n\\nBillie. On New Year\\u2019s Day they ask if they can kiss you. You say sure. No one has ever asked you this question. You barely feel the kiss, though, too lost in thought. You go on a few more dates, another kiss. You feel confused. You break up.\\n\\nSix months later you start dreaming about Billie. You see them in a new light. You get back together and it is summer and you feel free. The first time you have sex you\\u2019re both wearing purple underwear, the same shade. They seem to know what you like before you do. They hold down your wrists, press on your chest, squeeze your neck. You like this so much, and it occurs to you that you\\u2019ve barely thought about what you want in sex. Somehow you didn\\u2019t realize that what happens and how it happens is actually in your control. You\\u2019ve never told anyone what you want them to do to you, what you want to do to them.\\n\\n2013.\\n\\nYou tell Billie, blindfold me and tie my hands together. Pretend we are both boys having a sleepover. Lie on your back so I can slide my fingers inside you. Act like we just met each other. Talk about other people fucking us while we fuck each other. Pay me to fuck you. Get close to coming and then stop and put your clothes on, and start at the beginning.\\n\\nDo that again and again.\", \"row_index\": 26556, \"stack_trace\": \"NoneType: None\\n\"}\n"

      "{\"timestamp\": \"2025-04-09 23:48:00,725\", \"level\": \"ERROR\", \"message\": \"Received None response from model\", \"article_text\": \"(Photo by Alex Bl\\u0103jan on Unsplash)\\n\\nAll psychopaths follow the same strategy when operating in intimate relationships. I know this strategy well because I was in a relationship with a psychopath for around four years.\\n\\nI also know other women who dated and are dating psychopaths. Some of them are still abused, some of them had their lives totally destroyed. Only a few manage to break out, and the only reason that they do is covered at the end of this article.\\n\\nMany people mistake normal persons for narcissists or psychopaths. Many humans these days display psychopathic traits because they believe that only inhumane behavior would allow them to survive in this cruel world.\\n\\nBecause of such reasoning, some people act like psychopaths, but this act is external \\u2014 deep within they still have human warmth and finer feelings.\\n\\nReal psychopaths can be recognized by their eyes. You may not be able to see anything different about their eyes at first (though that is possible in some too), but if you keep your attention on their eyes, you will eventually see that behind those eyes there is emptiness.\\n\\nLooking at their eyes can be compared to looking at the bottomless abyss. You might even feel your spirit wanting to run away from what it sees in those dead eyes.\\n\\nTheir eyes look reptilian \\u2014 they are as dead as the eye of a lizard. That\\u2019s, I believe, the most sure way to tell whether a person is a psychopath or not.\\n\\nAnother way to tell whether a person is a psychopath is to look for the predatory behavior. All psychopaths, like predators, follow specific predatory steps. For example, a spider will follow a specific way to capture its prey; so will the lion. And so will the psychopath.\\n\\nThe psychopaths that I know are territorial. I don\\u2019t know if it applies to all of them, but this is very likely to be the case. They will hunt for prey as lone wolves and they will have their own particular territories that belong only to them, from what I\\u2019ve observed.\\n\\nThe strategy that the psychopath uses to enslave a victim into an intimate relationship is as follows (though the steps may not necessarily be followed in this order):\\n\\nLet me go into each stage to explain it more in detail.\\n\\nThe first stage: Seduce\\n\\n(In this article I choose a male psychopath and a female victim as an example. Psychopaths, however, can be either male or female.)\\n\\nWhen a psychopath first meets his victim, he will try to seduce her. He will do so by learning what kind of partner the woman desires. Psychopaths are excellent character readers, so they will quickly figure out what kind of partner the woman desires and he will become him.\\n\\nPsychopaths can read people like books; through different clues they understand whether the woman prefers a submissive boyish boyfriend, or a very mature and manly partner.\\n\\nAt this stage of seduction the psychopath will also try to mimic the victim so that she finds him interesting and he gains her trust. It\\u2019s now well-known through such methodologies as NLP that mirroring a person\\u2019s body language, for example, helps to form a friendly tie with a stranger. Psychopaths know this without the study of NLP. It\\u2019s in their blood to mimic the victim to gain their full trust.\\n\\nThe psychopath will mimic the victim in many ways. For example, he might adapt a similar dress style (formal, casual, sports, seductive). He might mimic the victim\\u2019s speech patterns, smile, attitudes, body language, and he might even use a similar-smelling perfume. He may adopt victim\\u2019s values and aspirations.\\n\\nWhat\\u2019s more, he will attract the victim through his self-confidence and good looks. Self-confident people are naturally attractive, and psychopaths know that they are found attractive because of this trait. So they will try to seduce the victim through their self-confident and daring behavior.\\n\\nThey might also fascinate the victim by their lifestyle which is usually extreme or dangerous in some way. For example, they might be fast bike-riders or be involved in anything else as dangerous; they seek such experiences so that they don\\u2019t feel dead within.\\n\\nThe second stage: Exalt and love-bomb\\n\\nAt this stage the psychopath will try to impress the victim to the degree that her entire focus is on him. He will try to become her personal hero, or, I might as well say, god.\\n\\nHe will try to make himself into her only idol; he will attempt to achieve the objective of the victim thinking mainly about him.\\n\\nHe will go more than an extra mile for her; he may act like a perfect selfless gentleman at this stage. He will buy her many gifts. He will tell her many compliments.\\n\\nHe will profess his undying love for her. He may tell that he never met such a special person before. He will spend all his free time with her and she will be his only source of focus.\\n\\nThis, of course, feels amazing and so the victim will indeed think that she is special for him. She\\u2019s likely at this stage to start falling in love with him. She will get addicted to his attention.\\n\\nHe wants her to get addicted to so much attention so that later on he could deny it.\\n\\nThe third stage: Bond\\n\\nAt this stage the psychopath will share his deepest secrets with the victim. They are likely to be no secrets at all but lies, since psychopaths are liars and they only tell the truth when they think it would be of some benefit.\\n\\nThe reason he discloses such \\u201csecrets\\u201d is so that the victim would disclose her secrets also, so that this would be used against her later on. He also does this to further bond with her.\\n\\nFurthermore, he will try to find out her weaknesses by careful observation and indirect questions. When people share their weaknesses with others, this strengthens the relationship bond.\\n\\nAnother reason a psychopath would want to know the victim\\u2019s weaknesses is so that he would use them against her at a later stage to totally crush her self-confidence.\\n\\nAt this stage he will also try to involve her in a sexual relationship because he knows that sex deeply bonds. Psychopaths crave raw and intense experiences so sex is likely to be frequent, fierce, and maybe even violent.\\n\\nThe psychopath will try to get his victim addicted to having sex with him because he wants her to become addicted \\u2014 he wants her to become his slave.\\n\\nHe might be excellent at love-making, since he is likely to have had many victims to practice on. Sex, in my opinion, is one of their greatest tools for enslavement of the victim, since most people become easily addicted to sex, and psychopaths know that very well.\\n\\nAt this stage the psychopath will spend a lot of time with the victim to get her total trust and so that all her doubts about him disappear. Thus, the victim will become fully trusting of the psychopath and deeply in love with him. And when this full trust and total love are achieved, the psychopath will deal the first blow.\\n\\nThe fourth stage: Trauma-bond\\n\\nAfter the psychopath is certain that the victim loves him and she fully trusts him, he strikes the first blow \\u2014 he either suddenly becomes indifferent, or violent, or involves her in a love triangle.\\n\\nHe might use any other strategy too. The main purpose of that strategy, whatever one he chooses to use, is to cause intense emotional upset or shock in a victim.\\n\\nHe does this because of a few reasons. First, trauma bonds the victim even more to the psychopath. This is because the victim starts associating intense feelings experienced during trauma with the person who caused it, and this creates a very strong bond.\\n\\nThe same scenario can be witnessed in captives who begin supporting their captors due to intense traumatization; the same can be witnessed in some rape cases where the victim becomes so attached to the rapist that she even thinks she loves him.\\n\\nThe second reason the psychopath uses trauma bonding is because the victim discharges intense emotional energy which he absorbs. Since he is a dead spiritual being devoid of feelings, he enjoys feeding off the intense feelings of others.\\n\\nAnother reason he uses trauma-bonding is to put the victim into an altered state of consciousness. The victim gets into a spellbound state because of cognitive dissonance \\u2014 the brain cannot comprehend how an absolutely loving person can suddenly turn violent or indifferent.\\n\\nThis is incomprehensible to the human mind because humans don\\u2019t act this way. And since most victims do not know that psychopaths aren\\u2019t normal humans, this causes a sort of split in the mind which puts the person into a highly vulnerable and suggestible state.\\n\\nThe psychopath will use this state to further enslave the victim \\u2014 he will use hypnotic speech patterns to rationalize his unpardonable behavior, and the victim, being in such an unwholesome state, is likely to believe in the psychopathic lies, getting further imbalanced and confused.\\n\\nIf the victim doesn\\u2019t understand the game of the psychopath, he may keep her in this trauma-bonding stage for years, until she loses her mind or is destroyed in other ways to the degree that he is no longer able to use her and therefore discards her.\\n\\nI recently heard that the end goal of all psychopaths is to make their victims die in some way, and I totally agree with that.\\n\\nBut he won\\u2019t rush the process. He wants the energy source \\u2014 he doesn\\u2019t want to kill fast. So he will let the victim recover from the shock by profusely apologizing and being exceptionally nice with her, spending all his time with her like he did in the early stages of bonding.\\n\\nWhen the victim feels recovered and happy again, the psychopath strikes the blow again. And this trauma bonding may go on for years, until the victim is totally destroyed.\\n\\nThis strategy will never change, though it might take time for trauma bonding to be repeated depending on how long it takes for the victim to recover and regain her trust in the psychopath.\\n\\nShould the victim decide to end the relationship, the psychopath will do everything he can to get her back. He will go through all the entrapment steps and will keep repeating them until the trust is regained.\\n\\nHe will love-bomb her, buy many gifts, use hypnotic language to change her mind, shed crocodile tears and promise to never do it again (whatever he did).\\n\\nHe will send multiple messages or will call many times. He will use such strategies every day until the victim decides to give him another chance. And then he will strengthen the bond to the degree that the victim fully trusts the psychopath so that the next trauma causes her to again discharge intense emotional energy which he will absorb.\\n\\nThe fifth stage: Entrap\\n\\nAt this stage (this can also be done earlier in the relationship) the psychopath will try to entrap the victim but will remain free himself. This can be done in many ways, depending on the circumstances.\\n\\nFor example, the psychopath may choose to impregnate the victim and thus the dependency/trap is created through the child. The psychopath may marry a Christian but then cheat her, and the Christian woman would be kept in the marriage because of her conviction that divorce is wrong.\\n\\nThe psychopath may isolate the victim from all her friends and family so that she only has him to rely on.\\n\\nBasically, he will assess the victim\\u2019s circumstances and will decide what\\u2019s the best way to entrap her so that her freedom is limited yet he himself remains free.\\n\\nThis will allow his other pursuits to be kept secret (he is likely to have many victims as such) and will give him flexibility in seeing the victim whenever he chooses. The victim, however, might be denied such freedom.\\n\\nFor example, I know one Indian lady who got entrapped this way. She got sexually involved with the psychopath before marriage, and that\\u2019s a big taboo in India.\\n\\nAlthough the woman loved him and wanted to get married to him, he didn\\u2019t share the same future plans. Instead, he told her that he could not marry her because she was one year older than him (!). So the psychopath came up with a plan to get her married to his relative. She agreed.\\n\\nNow he has easy access to her at any time, because he, as a relative, can visit her home without any suspicion. She, however, cannot visit the psychopath because she\\u2019s a married woman, so she cannot go to his house.\\n\\nThis allows him to have multiple women and remain uncaught most of the times (since he has many women, she still ends up catching him sometimes).\\n\\nHe impregnated her and told her to abort the baby, and she did. When, during her pregnancy, she found out that he was again cheating her, she almost committed suicide.\\n\\nShe\\u2019s totally trapped, yet she continues clinging to him because she thinks she loves him. The reason she thinks so is because he got her addicted to sex, closeness, and she also associates intense emotions with him. Since she\\u2019s an uneducated village girl, she doesn\\u2019t understand the real causes of such a bond and therefore in her mind she thinks that he\\u2019s the right person for her.\\n\\nHe also hypnotizes her with his speech patterns. Since she doesn\\u2019t understand that he\\u2019s not like a normal human being (I tried to explain that to her but it just goes over her head), she continues hoping that he would someday fall in love with her and that he would change.\\n\\nSo that\\u2019s how cleverly psychopaths can entrap their victims. They are smart, and they will premeditate the best plan of action. Since they are excellent actors, their suggestions that finally entrap you may seem as though serving your best interests, but that\\u2019s never the case.\\n\\nThe psychopath will use different entrapment strategies on his victims depending on their circumstances. Then, like a spider, he will freely move from victim to victim within his own created net to suck out their life energy and money.\\n\\nIf a few victims are located close to each other, the psychopath will try to set them against each other so that they never become friends and therefore are unable to exchange information. This way the dark deeds of a psychopath may remain undetected for years.\\n\\nThe sixth stage: Use up\\n\\nAs I\\u2019ve already mentioned, the psychopath will regularly use all his victims to get their emotional and sexual energies as well as money. He will give some time for the victims to recover, and then will deplete them again.\\n\\nHe will do this as long as there\\u2019s anything left to benefit from his victims.\\n\\nThe seventh stage: Discard\\n\\nFinally, when the victim is unable to be used for some reason (old age, poverty, illness), the psychopath will coldly discard her. He will do so in the most hurtful way, to deal a final, sometimes deadly, blow to the victim.\\n\\nThe victim, if she\\u2019s not aware of psychopathy, will never comprehend how a human being could be so cruel. Some victims will commit suicide. Some will start consuming alcohol or drugs. Others may self-destruct in other ways.\\n\\nSome will recover, but will never be the same; as ghosts that haunt houses, the thoughts about the abuser will visit the victim for the rest of her life. Only very few victims fully recover, and these are the ones who have their priorities right, as you will read below.\\n\\nThe only way to protect yourself\\n\\nThe only way a victim can protect herself from total psychopathic destruction is by having her priorities right. That\\u2019s the reason the psychopath that I was in a relationship with was unable to destroy me.\\n\\nHe got to the stage three, and he even tried trauma-bonding me, but that didn\\u2019t work in a way that he planned. That\\u2019s because he was never number one in my life.\\n\\nPsychopaths will attempt to make themselves into victims\\u2019 personal gods. They will try to appear as the most indispensable people in their lives. And when this is allowed to happen, the victims have just based their whole lives on a very shaky foundation.\\n\\nWhen the psychopath understands this has been accomplished, he will keep traumatizing the victim until she\\u2019s totally destroyed. But if the victim refuses to make him into her idol, she may get hurt because of his inhumane behavior, but she will never be fully destroyed.\\n\\nSpirituality was always number one in my life. Then came my business. And only then \\u2014 my ex-partner. That\\u2019s the reason I escaped from his deadly clutches.\\n\\nYet another thing that helps to survive psychopathic abuse is the firm understanding that a psychopath is not fully human. He operates through the reptilian brain, in a predatory manner.\\n\\nWhen you really understand that, it\\u2019s much easier to get detached from the abuser, heal, and move on.\", \"row_index\": 29889, \"stack_trace\": \"NoneType: None\\n\"}\n"

The man next to me having no clue that I was clenching my already wet pussy.\\n\\nOn my lunch break I read more, sucking Sir\\u2019s cock, being watched and begging to cum. I crossed and uncrossed my legs a few times, my eyes flickering if the slight movement managed to rub my clit. I wanted to hide in the bathroom and touch myself, I keep a near silent bullet vibe in my bag for such occasions\\u2026 but I didn\\u2019t. I waited.\\n\\nWhen I got home I would usually strip completely, changing into leggings and a loose t-shirt\\u2026. And today was no different\\u2026 but I kept my damp knickers on, I wanted to see what a full day of teasing would do. After doing some chores, and setting dinner cooking, I loaded up some porn on my laptop. I flicked through several videos. Group glory hole rooms, not knowing who was on the other side of the wall as they fucked you before them suddenly stopping and being filled with another hard cock\\u2026 It sent a little shiver through me. Ones filmed outside, dark alleys, open fields, inside cars\\u2026. I know it was all a set up but the idea of being outside, being watched, getting caught\\u2026 Fuck it was naughty\\u2026 my legs widened of their own accord but I managed to catch myself and sit up straight, closing my legs before I did anything.\\n\\nI had finished the chapter and closed the book of yet more erotica a little earlier than I usually would. I cleaned my teeth and finally removed my wet knickers. A damp patch about the size of my palm was very obvious on the dark material. There was a darker strip in the middle of it and even a slither of white\\u2026. Wow, did I have anything left I joked to myself as I striped once more, this time staying naked.\\n\\nI lay down on my back on my bed, shut my eyes and breathed deeply.\\n\\n\\u2018Hello Babygirl\\u2019 Your deep voice rumbled around the room.\\n\\n\\u2018Hello Daddy\\u2019\\n\\n\\u2018I saw your knickers in the bathroom, soaked, did you touch at all?\\u2019 Your voice had moved closer to me now. I shook my head. \\u2018No Daddy, I read, and watched but never touched\\u2019\\n\\n\\u2018Good girl, you can touch your breasts now and tell me what you read about\\u2019\\n\\nMy hands slid up from my sides to cup and squeeze at my chest. \\u2018I read about a girl being spanked and then fucked hard\\u2019 I pinched my nipples between my fingertips, a small gasp slipping from between my lips.\\n\\n\\u2018What else?\\u2019\\n\\n\\u2018I also read about a girl who touched herself while Sir watched her\\u2026Ah!\\u2019 I had pinched a little harder. \\u2018Then she was on her knees sucking his cock, getting it nice and wet\\u2019 I squeezed my breasts together.\\n\\n\\u2018Mmmmmm I like this Sir\\u2019s style, I too like to watch. Show me how wet you are Babygirl\\u2019\\n\\nKeeping my legs closed, I slid my feet up, bending my knees before lifting them up near my chest, then I opened them. I glanced down through them, just making out your silhouette standing at the foot of the bed. I pawed and scratched the flesh of my breasts before bringing them together once more as I ran a nail up and down over my nipples, the motion causing my to bounce a little on the bed.\\n\\n\\u2018And what did you watch Babygirl?\\u2019\\n\\n\\u2018Glory holes\\u2026 fucking outside\\u2026.\\u2019 My voice came out in little pants \\u2018I skipped through so many\\u2019\\n\\n\\u2018How did they make you feel?\\u2019\\n\\nI practically moaned \\u2018So fucking horny Daddy. I wanted to touch\\u2026. My clit aches for you Daddy, please\\u2026\\u2019\\n\\n\\u2018Please what Babygirl?\\u2019 You had moved to the side of the bed again.\\n\\nMy hands left my breasts to rest on the inside of my thighs, pushing them ever so slightly wider as I looked up at you. \\u2018Fuck me Daddy, make me cum\\u2019\\n\\n\\u2018Do you want me to fuck you like the naughty little slut you are?\\u2019\\n\\nYour words made my pussy clench. \\u2018Yes Daddy yes, I\\u2019m your naughty little slut\\u2019\\n\\n\\u2018Mmmmmm Such a good girl. Get my cock ready like the Sir in your story\\u2019 You knelt on the edge of the bed, waiting for me to lower my legs so you could swing your leg over and straddle my chest.\\n\\nYou were already half hard as you edged forward, brushing the tip across my lips. I took you in hand, looking up to you looming over me before placing a long hard lick under your cock from balls to tip, making you growl in your chest. I rubbed my lips along each side, feeling you get harder in my hand. I swirled my tongue around the cut head before sliding it in and out of my mouth, sucking and licking like it was an ice lolly.\\n\\n\\u2018Mmmmm Such a naughty slut sucking Daddy\\u2019s cock\\u2019\\n\\nYou were rock hard now, feeling firm in my hand as I squeezed the base and took more of you into my mouth, rubbing it along my tongue as I continued to suck, my eyes up and locked with yours.\\n\\n\\u2018Fuck yeah get it nice and wet\\u2019\\n\\nYou slid your fingers into my hair, gripping it slightly and tilting your hips ever so slightly forward as you leant back with the other hand to torture my clit with agonizingly slow circles. I moaned around your length, my eyes flickering at the little electric shocks from your fingertips were jolting through my clit, my wet pussy desperately clenching around nothing, silently begging for what my mouth had. I released your cock with a gasp, kissing and rubbing my lips along the thick length, my tongue under from base to tip, I know how much you loved feeling and watching me do that, before wrapping my already tingling and swollen lips back around the head. I could taste a little precum, and eagerly poked at the tip with my tongue while my lips kissed and sucked.\\n\\nYour finger tips slipped lower, gliding easily through my wetness to tap and rub at my entrance. \\u2018So wet Babygirl\\u2026Do you like sucking Daddy\\u2019s cock?\\u2019\\n\\nI hummed contently around you for a second before taking you from my mouth. \\u2018Yes Daddy, I love sucking your cock\\u2019 You gripped my hair tighter, tilting my head back so your dick lay against my panting lips. \\u2018And what does that make you?\\u2019\\n\\nI smiled and flicked my tongue against your hot flesh. \\u2018A naughty slut\\u2019\\n\\n*SMACK*\\n\\nHeat and pain resonated across my leg. I hadn\\u2019t even felt you move your hand from my pussy to strike the outside of my thigh. A high pitched squeal left me as I gasped, yet continued to smile. \\u2018Yours Daddy Yours!\\u2019 I licked and sucked the underside of your cock. \\u2018Your Naughty Slut!\\u2019\\n\\n\\u2018Brat\\u2019 You growled, but I could see a feral grin on your face. You knew I said it wrong on purpose.\\n\\nYou released my hair and edged down my body, and when my legs were free I lifted them, opening them wide and looked between them at you, poised at the foot of the bed like a tiger about to pounce. \\u2018Fuck me Daddy\\u2019\\n\\nYou slid between my open legs, placing one hand by my ribs, hovering over me. You grabbed your cock, rubbing and teasing the tip up and down between my lips. \\u2018You want this Babygirl?\\u2019 I reached for you, running my hands up your chest to caress your scruffy cheeks. \\u2018Please Daddy\\u2026Stop teasing\\u2019 You leant down and as you pushed your hips forward you sealed our lips together, capturing my moan as you slide just a little inside me. You stayed there a moment, before pulling back and sliding in a little further. You broke the kiss to look into my eyes once more. \\u2018You wound so tight Babygirl that you\\u2019ll tensed up\\u2026 relax\\u2019 and you lent down and started placing open mouthed kisses along my jaw and down my neck. \\u2018C\\u2019mon Babygirl\\u2019 You whispered against my heated skin as you pushed in a little more. \\u2018Take all of me\\u2019\\n\\n\\u2018So big Daddy\\u2026\\u2019 I moaned before closing my eyes, taking a breath and holding it. I could feel your kisses against my collarbone. The slight ache of my legs as I held them up and you pushed them apart. The way your cock stretched me wide. I could smell your aftershave. Every sense felt heightened. Every feeling was so intense\\u2026 I felt like I was going to explode\\u2026 I released the breath.\\n\\nYou must of felt it, cause as my body relaxed you pushed all the way in. \\u2018Oh God!\\u2019\\n\\n\\u2018There we go\\u2026such a good girl\\u2019 Your lips left my neck. \\u2018Look at me\\u2019\\n\\nI opened my eyes and you were looking down at me like I was the most precious thing in the world.\\n\\nYou slid out a little and thrust back in. \\u2018Oh\\u2026.\\u2019 You did it again. \\u2018Oh!\\u2019 Again. \\u2018Oh Fuck!\\u2019 And you didn\\u2019t stop. You started to fuck me with short sharp thrusts as you watched my face. \\u2018I\\u2026\\u2019\\n\\n\\u2018Say it Babygirl\\u2019\\n\\n\\u2018I\\u2026\\u2019\\n\\nYou pulled out nearly all the way out, just leaving my entrance quivering around the tip.\\n\\n\\u2018Say it\\u2019\\n\\nBetween breaths I managed to pant out \\u2018I feel so\\u2026 So full Daddy\\u2019\\n\\n\\u2018Good Girl\\u2019 And you began to fuck me again. Long, hard, deep thrusts now, making my lower stomach and pussy ache with not want, but need. I could hear both yours and mines ragged breaths, the slap of skin on skin and the naughty, no, the down right fucking dirty sound as your cock slid through my wet pussy.\\n\\n\\u2018Touch yourself for me Babygirl\\u2019\\n\\nYour words cut through my trance and I once again palmed, squeezed, pinched at my breasts and nipples.\\n\\nI could feel my orgasm building quickly, already on edge from teasing myself all day. The ache of need beginning to bloom outward from the epicenter between my legs. I began to chase that feeling, my eyes shutting tightly, gritting my teeth and thrusting back harder against you as I squeezed and scratched at my nipples.\\n\\n\\u2018Look at me\\u2019\\n\\nI glanced up. In the low light I could just make out some of your features, the deep furrow of your concentrated brow, the ridge of your nose, your breath coming out in pants between your parted lips. You leant back, your thrusts slowing, becoming longer\\u2026 almost languid as you held my thighs tightly. Pulling all the way till barely the tip was inside, my pussy clenching, missing what it desperately craved, before slowly pushing all the way back in, filling me up again as I felt your hips grind against me. Over and over and over you repeated this almost torturous act.\\n\\n\\u2018Please\\u2026\\u2019 I pleaded. I wasn\\u2019t ashamed with you, to beg for what I wanted\\u2026what I needed.\\n\\nYour lips quirked up in the corner as your continued to thrust slowly. You loved it when I begged for something\\u2026 you loved denying it even more. \\u2018Please Daddy please\\u2026\\u2019\\n\\nYou slid all the way inside me, and then all the way out, before once again rubbing your cock between my folds, the cut head teasing my aching clit. \\u2018What do you want Babygirl?\\u2019\\n\\n\\u2018Your cock Daddy\\u2019 My hand caressed down my body to hold myself open, everything always felt better when my lips were parted \\u2018But you already have my cock\\u2026\\u2019 You thrust back in and out once, making me shiver, to punctuate your point. I teased my finger tips against your cock briefly, they came away slicked with my own juices. I brought them to my mouth and licked them while looking straight at you.\\n\\n\\u2018Please Daddy\\u2026.fuck me hard\\u2026\\u2019\\n\\n\\u2018How could I deny such a request\\u2026.\\u2019 You stopped teasing. \\u2018Turn over Babygirl\\u2019\\n\\nI turned over as quick as could. I knew what you wanted from me\\u2026 Face down, ass up. I wiggled my bottom at you as I moved my knees wide apart, and you rewarded me with a few short sharp smacks to both cheeks before you slammed your cock back inside me, hard and fast\\u2026\\n\\n\\u2018Is this what you wanted?\\u2019 Your hands almost bruising on my hips held me steady. \\u2018On your knees, being fucked hard by Daddy\\u2019s cock huh?\\u2019 You spanked me again. \\u2018Fucking naughty little slut. Is this what you wanted?\\u2019\\n\\nI let out a noise that was somewhere between a moan, a gasp and maybe a squeak. \\u2018Ah! Yes Daddy Yes! I fucking love your cock!\\u2019 The fire inside me blazed into an inferno, I felt like I was going to combust. I had never felt such an ache in my cunt before, they way you were filling me up, fucking me, using me\\u2026. I went to reach between my legs to touch myself, my knees slipping further apart. Just as my fingers found my soaking clit, pain burned in my leg. \\u2018Ah! Fuck! Shit! Cramp\\u2026.\\u2019 You stopped, turned me onto my side and fell behind me. The pain eased as I managed to stretch my leg straight. \\u2018Better?\\u2019\\n\\n\\u2018Yes\\u2026 much\\u2026Oh!\\u2019 As soon as I said yes you lifted my other leg high and slid back in. It wasn\\u2019t quite as fast on our sides, but damn it was hard and felt so good with your whole body flushed to mine. I hooked my foot behind your hip, making my back arch so I could thrust back as hard as I could. Your hand slid along my leg slowly, a trail of arousal and anticipation creeping towards where I knew you were going. \\u2018Look at me\\u2026\\u2019 Your breath came out deep and ragged. \\u2018I want to see your eyes when you cum all over my cock\\u2019\\n\\nI turned to look at you, even in the dim light I could see the blaze of lust in your eyes. You wiggled your other hand under my head until I felt your finger tips touch gently on the sides of my neck. Higher and higher up my leg your fingers crept. Closer and closer to my pussy. My eyes began to slip shut, the sweet anticipation of what was about to happen\\u2026\\n\\n\\u2018Nah ah Babygirl\\u2026. Eyes on me\\u2026.\\u2019\\n\\n\\u2018Please\\u2026.. Daddy\\u2026\\u2019 I managed to gasp out, eyes wide and locked with yours. \\u2018Touch\\u2026 my\\u2026 pussy\\u2026 make me cum\\u2026\\u2019\\n\\n\\u2018You really want it\\u2026. My naughty little slut?\\u2019\\n\\n\\u2018Yes! Daddy Yes!\\u2019\\n\\nThe finger tips on the sides of my neck gripped a little harder\\u2026 just as the fingers on my hip slipped a little lower\\u2026. I forced my eyes to stay open, staring at your shadowed face as my breath caught in my throat\\u2026. Suddenly, there was no hand on my hip\\u2026. Your fingers were rough and fast, rubbing up and down over my clit furiously as your cock hammered in and out. The pressure on my neck increased, I couldn\\u2019t help but moan loudly with every pant. It was too much\\u2026. I squealed and tensed up as I reached the precipice, my heart was hammering in my chest as I let go\\u2026.\\n\\nMy pussy pulsed and squeezed your cock over and over as I exhaled and relaxed in your arms, keeping my eyes locked with yours. You released the pressure on the sides on my neck, my whole body shivering with another wave of pleasure as the blood rushed back to my head. Your fingers continued to rub and squeeze at my clit as you fucked me through my orgasm. \\u2018C\\u2019mon Babygirl\\u2026.give me another one\\u2026\\u2019\\n\\nI didn\\u2019t think I could\\u2026 I didn\\u2019t think I had another one in me\\u2026 You proved me wrong as I shivered once more and felt wetness trickle down my leg as I squirted all over your hand and cock. You released my clit and gripped my hips, thrusting hard, fast and erratic as you yourself came. Holding yourself inside me as you groaned loudly.\\n\\nYou held me tightly against you, rocking me gently. \\u2018Such a good girl\\u2019 You whispered as I felt you press your lips to my forehead. I smiled, sated\\u2026\\n\\nI shivered as the coolness of the room washed over my heated skin. Sighing, I reached down between my legs, gasping slightly and feeling the loss as I gripped the wide base of \\u2018Daddy\\u2019 and pulled him out of my aching pussy. I brought him to my lips, sliding the long shaft across them and sucking the tip, eagerly tasting myself from him.\\n\\n\\u2018Thank you Daddy\\u2019 I whispered, before leaning over and dropping him into the little bag by my bed. I reached back, pulling the duvet tightly over me before drifting off into a contented deep sleep.\", \"row_index\": 31920, \"stack_trace\": \"NoneType: None\\n\"}\n"

Yes, I know you do a million push-ups a day and you are totally cut and your guns are enormous and your six-pack abs are up to seven last time I counted. It\\u2019s not you, it\\u2019s me.\\n\\nBut since you are giving me that face and you look like you\\u2019re very disappointed, and you\\u2019re kinda waiting for me to give you the mercy jerk-off, I would like to investigate this issue, if I may.\\n\\nWhy exactly am I the bad guy here? All I wanted was to be left alone (please say that line to yourself in a Garbo accent, reader).\\n\\nMen like to sulk\\n\\nAnd not just when they don\\u2019t get sex. When they don\\u2019t get anything they want, they sulk. They really do.\\n\\nI blame their mothers. Somewhere back in their childhood, they got the idea that someone actually gave a shit about their pouty little face.\\n\\nNobody gives a shit about your pouty little face, dude, so turn that frown upside down, let\\u2019s make some popcorn and watch Queen\\u2019s Gambit. There\\u2019s more to life than your need to ejaculate.\\n\\nNo, I\\u2019m not kidding. I\\u2019m not going to jerk you off.\\n\\nBut why, then, do I feel guilty?\\n\\nYes, the male is being microaggressive, but it takes two to play this game, and I do my part dutifully by letting my \\u201cfear of abandonment\\u201d take control of me.\\n\\nJust as men were taught that their sulking matters, girls in childhood pretty quickly learn that men leave.\\n\\nMen all over the world in every city and town and village, have excelled in this one sport \\u2014 leaving.\\n\\nThe art of taking off has been perfected by them. The act of dumping women has been made into a national sport. Back in the day, there were a million songs about this talent of men. \\u201cI\\u2019m a ramblin\\u2019 man. Gotta ramble on. See ya.\\u201d\\n\\nAnd we women are left there with faces agog, going, \\u201cWhat did I do wrong?\\u201d\\n\\nThis nightmarish scenario flashes through our heads when men pull the microaggressive sulk routine after we refuse to jerk them off.\\n\\n\\u201cWhat if he dumps me because I wasn\\u2019t sexy enough?\\u201d\\n\\nGet over your fear of abandonment!\\n\\nIf a guy dumps you because you don\\u2019t jerk him off whenever he wants you to, you haven\\u2019t lost much, trust me. The best way to not listen to those voices that scare you and make you feel that you need to be inauthentic and people-pleasing when it comes to sex is to remember your rights. America has a Constitution. Yeah, he has the right to pursue happiness by trying to fuck you. And you have the right to pursue it by saying no.\\n\\nSome reminders to help you feel confident in saying no\\n\\nKnow that even if they leave, you will be fine. You are self-sufficient and have made it this far in life, so you\\u2019re not going to collapse if he runs.\\n\\nKnow that it is your right to refuse sex. Any time you want to. Yes, you will do your best to be a good sexual partner, but not at the expense of your own well being. When you\\u2019re not in the mood, you\\u2019re allowed to say no. It\\u2019s OK!\\n\\nKnow that he\\u2019s being a baby, and when his more grown-up self re-emerges he won\\u2019t hold it against you. Trust in his personal development as much as you trust in your own. We\\u2019re all pilgrims in this land, learning as we go, and hopefully getting better.\\n\\nGo ahead and apologize, without being weak about it. \\u201cSorry dude, not gonna happen tonight, wish I could, but I can\\u2019t. What\\u2019s on TV?\\u201d\\n\\nDon\\u2019t give his sulking any weight. The poor attention the child gets, the more he will sulk. So yes, you have to pretend to ignore it. And then later, after he\\u2019s done sulking, let him know that it\\u2019s not OK for him to pull those babyish sulk routines. You expect him to act like more of a grown up.

This may be difficult for some readers.\\n\\nOne of the safest countries in the world, Japan is known for its low crime rate, safe neighborhoods, and close-knit communities that watch over each other. Guns are virtually absent and murder and other violent crimes are very low with the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime reporting Japan\\u2019s rate of intentional homicide being the second-lowest in the world at 0.3, compared with 5.4 for the United States.\\n\\nBut despite that, Japan has some very unusual and brutal crimes that shock and confuse both Japanese people and the world. One such criminal is Tsutomu Miyazaki, a man from Saitama Japan who abducted four girls ranging from age 4 to 7 and brutally murdered them, sexually assaulted their corpses, and even consumed some of their body parts and drank their blood which earned him the name Little Girl Murderer.\\n\\nHe was also an avid fan of horror and violent Japanese manga so the media often referred to him as the Otaku killer. Otaku is the Japanese word for nerd or geek.\\n\\nWhy was Miyazaki obsessed with little girls? Why did he sexually assault their corpses? Was his love for anime and horror an influence in his killings? Was he suffering from mental illness, and if so how extreme was it that he decided to drink the blood and eat the flesh of his victims? How was he caught and what happened to him? Find out the life and crimes of Tsutomu Miyazaki and why this man and his crimes shocked a nation and the world.\\n\\nVictims of Miyazaki (Source: talkmurder.com)\\n\\nThe Crime\\n\\n\\u201c\\u2019Would you like to go somewhere where it\\u2019s cool?\\u2019 he asked the little girl. She agreed, and taking his hand, climbed into his car.\\u201d\\n\\nMari Konno (Source: murderminute)\\n\\nMari\\n\\nIn the Japanese prefecture of Saitama, on August 22, 1988, a four-year-old girl named Mari left her home and headed to her friend\\u2019s house. But after she didn\\u2019t report back in the evening, her father called the police and reported her missing. One man knew where she was.\\n\\nOn August 22nd, the day after his 26th birthday, Tsutomu Miyazaki, who lived in the area close to Mari was driving his car when he spotted the little girl. \\u201cWould you like to go somewhere where it\\u2019s cool?\\u201d he asked Mari, who agreed and taking his hand, climbed into his car.\\n\\nIn Japan, children are always taught to respect and obey elders and in the 80s and 90s, kidnappings and crime, in general, were very low in Saitama so it was no wonder Miyazaki was able to lead the young Mari into his car and drive her to a remote location and park under a bridge.\\n\\nHe then walked with her to a patch of forested area and watched her play for 30 minutes before putting his hands around her neck and strangling her. When she stopped moving, he undressed her and sexually assaulted her corpse. He took off her clothes and brought them home as a souvenir leaving her body in the field.\\n\\nA few days after Mari disappeared, Mari\\u2019s family received a postcard with a message: There are devils about.\\n\\nA massive search took place with 50,000 posters of Mari\\u2019s image being hung in train stations and bus stops across Japan. Police questioned people in the neighborhood and two boys and a housewife reported seeing Mari with a stranger; they described a pudgy man in his late thirties with curly hair.\\n\\nMari\\u2019s family started getting strange phone calls that would ring for up to 20 minutes. When the family answered, the person on the other end would hang up or heavy breathing could be heard.\\n\\nDespite the efforts, after weeks without any leads, the case went cold. There was no body, no more witnesses, and nothing that could link anyone to the disappearance. Serial killers usually get bolder and more extreme in the way they murder as they progress and Miyazaki was no different.\\n\\nMasami Yoshizawa (Source: murderminute.com)\\n\\nMasami\\n\\nSix weeks after Mari\\u2019s disappearance, on October 3, 1988, Miyazaki spotted Masami Yoshizawa, a seven-year-old first-grader, walking down the street. He was able to coerce her into his car, drive to the hills near the location of his first murder, and strangled her to death. Then he stripped her and sexually abused the corpse.\\n\\nHe once again took the clothes and left her remains less than 100 meters (around 300 feet) from Mari\\u2019s remains. The police were quick to link the missing girls as both Mari and Masami lived in a similar vicinity but there were still no leads or bodies found so Masami was also listed as a missing person.\\n\\nMasami\\u2019s family also reported getting strange crank calls where the caller would repeatedly call but never say a word.\\n\\nErika Namba (Source: birthfactdeathcalendar)\\n\\nErika\\n\\nOn December 12, 1988, Erika Namba was returning from a friend\\u2019s house when Miyazaki lured her into his sedan. She was crying by the time he pulled into the parking area. He told Erika to undress in the back seat, then began to photograph her. He strangled Erika as he had Mari and Masami, then tied her legs and arms, wrapped her in a sheet, and put her in the trunk. This time though, instead of taking her clothes as a souvenir, he disposed of them.\\n\\nWhile he was driving to dispose of Erika\\u2019s body, his car slipped and got stuck. So he quickly grabbed the body out of the trunk and ran into the woods to dump it. When he returned with just the sheet, two men were standing by his car apparently worried about the abandoned car. They helped him push the car out of the hole where it was stuck and Miyazaki sped off.\\n\\nErika\\u2019s family also received strange phone calls and a postcard that had the words: Erika. Cold. Cough. Throat. Rest. Death.\\n\\nBecause of the car troubles, Miyazaki wasn\\u2019t able to properly dispose of Erika\\u2019s body. A few days after her death, her clothes and body were found. The two men also reported the incident of seeing Miyazaki and described his car but couldn\\u2019t remember the make so there was still no identification of the car or Miyazaki.\\n\\nWhat was confirmed though was that all three girls who lived relatively close to each other were being kidnapped, and killed. Although police had only found Erika\\u2019s body, they were pretty certain that the other missing girls were most likely dead as well. The police set up a special unit and began combing the area for the other two girl\\u2019s remains.\\n\\nWhile police were searching for the girls and a serial killer, Miyazaki had gone back and retrieved Mari\\u2019s body, cut off the hands and feet, hung them in his closet, and burned the rest of her body in his furnace.\\n\\nHe then sent the burnt remains, Mari\\u2019s baby teeth, and photo\\u2019s of the clothes Mari was wearing when she disappeared in a box with a note that read: Mari. Bones. Cremated. Investigate. Proof.\\n\\nThe ashes were turned over to the legal division of the Tokyo Dental University for examination, where Dr. Kazuo Suzuki concluded they probably did not belong to Mari. Because the examiner reported that the remains may not be Mari, Miyazaki had to set the record straight.\\n\\nThe Japanese newspaper Asahi Shinbun received a letter and polaroid photo of Mari. The letter was signed with a fake name Yuko Imada, which is a women\\u2019s name but is also a wordplay which can also mean I\\u2019ll tell you now in Japanese. The letter was a confession that read,\\n\\n\\u201cI put the cardboard box with Mari\\u2019s remains in it in front of her home. I did everything. From the start of the Mari incident to the finish. I saw the police press conference where they said the remains were not Mari\\u2019s. On camera, her mother said the report gave her new hope that Mari might still be alive. I knew then that I had to write this confession so Mari\\u2019s mother would not continue to hope in vain. I say again: the remains are Mari\\u2019s.\\u201d\\n\\nAfter a further medical examination of the remains, they were confirmed to be that of Mari. However, her hands and feet were missing. At Mari\\u2019s funeral, her father urged the killer, \\u201cHer hands and feet didn\\u2019t seem to be with the remains. When she gets to heaven, she won\\u2019t be able to walk or eat. Please return the rest of her remains.\\u201d\\n\\nAlthough the police were not able to identify the killer by the writing, the photograph, the postcard paper and the box that was sent was a starting point for the police and a hint at who the culprit might be.\\n\\nAyako Nomoto (Source: murderminute.com)\\n\\nAyako\\n\\nDespite the close call with Erika, Miyazaki was getting bolder and more determined to find another target. On June 1, 1989, he once again got a young girl playing at her Elementary school to come with him. He was taking pictures of her and taking off her panties when some people saw what was happening and chased him off.\\n\\nUnfortunately, that did not deter Miyazaki, as a few days later he found 5-year-old Ayako playing alone in a park. He approached with his camera and asked her to pose for him. He took her to his car and gave her some gum to keep her calm and happy.\\n\\nAccording to Miyazaki\\u2019s confession, the young girl commented on his deformed hands. Miyazaki had been born with a physical defect that caused his hand joints to fuse together and limit his hand movement.\\n\\nEnraged, Miyazaki pulled on a pair of vinyl gloves. \\u201cHere\\u2019s what happens to kids who say things like that,\\u201d he said and then started strangling her. \\u201cShe kicked and kicked, but went limp in four or five minutes,\\u201d he confessed. To make sure she was dead, he taped her mouth and tied her hands with vinyl rope, then wrapped the body in a sheet and put it in the trunk of the car.\\n\\nInstead of disposing of her like he had the other three girls, this time he decided to bring the body home. He brought her body to his home, stripped her clothes, wiped her with a towel, spread her legs, and taped her vagina open. He then went on to film the body while he masturbated.\\n\\nHe then used a knife and saw to cut off her head, hands, and feet. He dumped the torso near a public toilet at a cemetery then roasted Ayako\\u2019s hands which he proceeded to eat and drank some of her blood.\\n\\nHe kept some bones and her head in his home until later scattering them in the woods. He also burned her hair, clothes, and the blood-stained plastic bags he had used to transport her.\\n\\nAyako\\u2019s mother had reported her missing on June 6th and a week later, Ayako\\u2019s torso was found. Using blood type, chest size, and stomach contents, police were able to confirm the body belonged to Ayako.\\n\\nDespite the sighting of Miyazaki and his car by the two men earlier and the clues from the package he had sent the victim\\u2019s families, Miyazaki was still able to escape detection and police were nowhere close to identifying their serial killer.\\n\\nLuckily, despite the police still having no leads, Miyazaki\\u2019s hunger for new victims was his downfall. On July 23, 1989, Miyazaki came upon two sisters playing outside. He convinced the younger sister to accompany him to the river where he could take pictures of her. The older sister, however, ran home and told her father who came running to save his younger daughter.\\n\\nThe father ended up finding the young daughter naked while Miyazaki was taking pictures between her legs. He approached, knocked Miyazaki down but Miyazaki was able to escape to his car. Luckily, the police had been called and were waiting for him by his car.\\n\\nMiyazaki (Source: criminalminds)\\n\\nThe Killer\\n\\n\\u201cI felt all alone. And whenever I saw a little girl playing on her own, it was almost like seeing myself.\\u201d\\n\\nTsutomu Miyazaki was born in Tokyo on August 21, 1962. He was born prematurely weighing only 2.2kg or 4.8 lbs with a birth defect that caused the joints of his hands to fuse together. The deformation was a major point of bullying he received when he was a child. His classmates and teacher all said he was a quiet and lonely child who had trouble making friends.\\n\\nDespite his detachment from others, he was a smart student and was the first student from his junior high school to pass the entrance exams to an elite high school. And though he was a good student, in high school he started losing interest in studies and instead opted to sit alone and draw comics.\\n\\nOriginally he had planned to major in English and become a teacher but as his marks fell and his interest in school dropped, he was no longer able to attend the university his school was affiliated with and so he ended up taking a photo technician course at junior college.\\n\\nMiyazaki\\u2019s father was a quite wealthy and prominent businessman who owned a printing business and the local newspaper. Through his father\\u2019s connections, he was able to find work at a printing plant.\\n\\nIt seems that Miyazaki did not get along well with his family. Both his mother and father seemed to be too busy to pay him much attention. He admitted to police, \\u201cIf I tried to talk to my parents about my problems, they\\u2019d just brush me off. I even thought about suicide.\\u201d\\n\\nEven Miyazaki\\u2019s two younger sisters, Setsuko and Haruko, didn\\u2019t like him. Miyazaki was a troubled child and there was an instance when his youngest sister yelled at him for peeking at her naked body while she was in the bath. Angered by her, he burst in and smashed her head against the bathtub.\\n\\nHe also beat his mother once when she suggested he stopped reading comics and watching movies and do something more productive.\\n\\nHis violent tendencies also included cruelty to animals. \\u201cI\\u2019ve killed cats. Threw one in the river. Did another in with boiling water.\\u201d He also strangled his own dog to death with a strand of wire.\\n\\nMiyazaki seemed to only get along with his grandfather who ended up passing away in May of 1988 a few months before Miyazaki took his first human life. According to a specialist Mr. Serizawa,\\n\\nhis grandfather had been his only warm adult relationship, and the death marked the breaking of Miyazaki\\u2019s last bonds with society. Miyazaki later said that he even ate some of his grandfather\\u2019s cremated bones. He wanted to reincarnate his grandfather and believed that this reincarnation would not be complete if any of his grandfather\\u2019s body remained.\\n\\nAlong with friction with his sister and mother, Miyazaki avoided women his own age. \\u201cHis penis is no thicker than a pencil and no longer than a toothpick,\\u201d a high-school classmate remarked. His premature birth, hand defect, and other physical and mental abnormalities caused Miyazaki to act out in strange ways.\\n\\nAt college, he took cameras to the tennis courts to take crotch shots of female players. He also soon tired of adult pornography. In Japan, both magazine and video pornography blackout or blur pubic hair. \\u201cThey black out the most important part,\\u201d Miyazaki complained. So he turned to child porn, which shows everything since obscenity laws ban the showing of pubic hair, not sex organs.\\n\\nMiyazaki\\u2019s room filled with videos and magazines (Source: Reddit)\\n\\nAfter Miyazaki\\u2019s arrest, police searched his home to find 6,000 videotapes of kiddy porn, gruesome horror movies, and anime. His collection also included videos and photos of his victims.\\n\\nAfter information on Miyazaki was released there was a lot of debate about horror movies, violence in anime, and pornography with many people vilifying anime and manga culture.\\n\\nDubbed the Otaku Killer, many single men who are obsessed with manga, anime, video games, and pornography were looked at in a negative light. Japanese society was attacking anime entertainment and youth culture and blaming it for the rise of Miyazaki much like hip hop and heavy metal was blamed for the deterioration of society in North America.\\n\\nFuneral of Mari (Source: murderminute.com)\\n\\nArrest and Sentencing\\n\\nOriginally, Miyazaki was apprehended on the charge of forcing a minor to commit indecent acts when he was caught photographing the younger sister. However, once he was in police custody and interrogated, Miyazaki confessed to murdering Ayako.\\n\\nThen as police probed further, other confessions followed including the murder of Erika Namba and Mari Konno. Both Mari and Erika\\u2019s videos were found in the collection at Miyazaki\\u2019s home.\\n\\nAfter a preliminary psychological test by psychiatrists concluded that Miyazaki showed no immediately apparent disorders, he finally confessed to killing Masami as well. Masami\\u2019s remains were found in the forest as well as the chewed bones of Mari\\u2019s hands and feet.\\n\\nMiyazaki\\u2019s trial started in March 1990 and his trial lasted 7 years. In Japanese law, if someone is determined to have no mental competence, they can\\u2019t be punished and if they have a diminished mental capacity, their sentence can be lowered.\\n\\nThe defense team claimed that Miyazaki had only a limited sense of responsibility for his crimes and that he was unable to choose between right and wrong. \\u201cWe want to build enough of a case for the judge to sentence Miyazaki to life in prison,\\u201d said his lawyer. However, the first report found Miyazaki capable of taking responsibility for his actions.\\n\\nThe defense asked for a second evaluation which the Judge agreed to. He had two more evaluations conducted which concluded that he suffered from schizophrenia and multiple personality disorder. During the trial, Miyazaki was drawing pictures of a Rat-man who he claimed was the real murderer.\\n\\nSketches Miyazaki drew of Rat-man (Source: warosu.org)\\n\\nHowever, despite the evaluations, he was still sentenced to death by hanging. \\u201cThe atrocious murder of four girls to satisfy his sexual desire leaves no room for leniency,\\u201d Chief Justice Tokiyasu Fujita.\\n\\nMiyazaki\\u2019s legal team appealed to have his sentence be changed to life in prison but the upper courts and Supreme court upheld his death sentence.\\n\\nMiyazaki reportedly said: \\u201cThis has to be wrong. I\\u2019ll be proved innocent someday.\\u201d In his letter, while on death row he also wrote things like, \\u201cThis is silly. That judge will be sorry. He must be an idiot,\\u201d and about the victims, \\u201cThere\\u2019s nothing much to say about them. I\\u2019m happy to think I did a good deed.\\u201d\\n\\nHe also demanded his collection of videos and his car be returned to him and that he be given a lethal injection like in America as opposed to hanging. He wrote,\\n\\n\\u201cUnder the current execution method [in Japan], death row inmates have to suffer great fear at the time of their execution, and therefore won\\u2019t have a chance to feel regret for what they\\u2019ve done. For this reason, we should switch to lethal injections of the kind used in the United States.\\u201d\\n\\nDuring the trial, Miyazaki\\u2019s father refused to hire a lawyer for his son. \\u201cIt wouldn\\u2019t be fair to the victims,\\u201d he said. After the trial, his father shut down his newspaper business and went into hiding. In an interview, he said, \\u201cI didn\\u2019t pay more attention to the feelings of my son.\\u201d\\n\\nAfter his arrest, Miyazaki had written a furious letter to his father, blaming him for everything. And to his mother, \\u201cI\\u2019ve caused you much heartache. Don\\u2019t forget to change the oil in my car, or it will get so you can\\u2019t drive it.\\u201d\\n\\nHis father committed suicide soon after Miyazaki\\u2019s guilty verdict. After spending years in prison reading his beloved manga and watching anime and movies all day awaiting his execution, Miyazaki was hanged at the Tokyo Detention House in 2008.\\n\\nSince Miyazaki was executed and while alive was suffering from mental illness and delusions, we may never know what caused a mild-mannered man to become such a vile and grotesque killer.\\n\\nHis issues with his parents, the disability of his hands, the bullying and resentment from classmates, all may have combined to create an awful and miserable childhood for Miyazaki. Despite his academic success and ambition, he somehow failed to escape the sadness and abuse he suffered as a young child and adult.\\n\\nAdd the obsession with video games, pornography, and horror films, his secluded life with little human interaction might have increased his mental illness and added to his delusions and a strange fascination with little girls.\\n\\nAnd although the crimes he committed against the four innocent children were quite atrocious and extremely morbid, luckily he was caught before he could get his misshapen hands on any other children.\\n\\nCompared to some of the other strange hikikomori murderers that have plagued Japan, his victim count may be lower but his style of murder is beyond belief. And although justice was served and Miyazaki has gone, the legacy of his bizarre killings continues to fascinate the people of Japan and the world.\", \"row_index\": 35748, \"stack_trace\": \"NoneType: None\\n\"}\n"

      "{\"timestamp\": \"2025-04-10 00:18:57,307\", \"level\": \"ERROR\", \"message\": \"Received None response from model\", \"article_text\": \"Game of Thrones has never been a stranger to controversy, especially in regards to how it portrays women. From its very first episode, the series has depicted an onslaught of violence, sadism, and rape, often directed at female characters.\\n\\nTo be fair, much of this is runoff from the fact that the show is set in a brutally paternalistic world inspired by very real periods of human history. However, the repeated use of female objectification\\u2014 whether as props for exposition, titillating scene enhancement, or objects of assault \\u2014 grated on many critics and viewers over time as gratuitous, even demeaning. The story\\u2019s depiction of a nonchalant attitude towards misogyny could sometimes be read as the series itself taking a nonchalant attitude, and admittedly that confusion could be understandable.\\n\\nThis tension reached a cultural nadir in the middle of the show\\u2019s fifth season, with the episode \\u201cUnbowed, Unbent, Unbroken.\\u201d In that hour\\u2019s conclusion, Sansa Stark is married to the psychopathic Ramsay Bolton, who proceeds to conjugate their new union by raping and assaulting her, and forcing Sansa\\u2019s surrogate brother Theon to watch.\\n\\nThe reaction proved swift and damning. Missouri senator Claire McCasklill condemned the series on Twitter, vowing never to watch it again. Websites such as the Mary Sue swore off coverage of the show, and countless think pieces were written about how Game of Thrones had reached a level of moral irresponsibility from which it might never recover. More measured responses still found the scene unforgivable, having lazily indulged rape as a plot device yet again in order to employ shock value, and urged its creators to do better. And the episode\\u2019s writer, Bryan Cogman, received threats on social media, particularly following an Entertainment Weekly article where he was quoted as saying that Sansa had made a \\u201cchoice\\u201d and now \\u201cwill have to deal with it.\\u201d\\n\\nSo, apart from the general outcry, what were the specific arguments against this scene, and was it really the vile misstep so many claimed at the time?\\n\\n1. It serves no real function other than to be horrific.\\n\\nThe gist here is that the show has used rape on countless occasions to illustrate how awful Westeros can get, and subjecting a character like Sansa to such well-trod treatment highlights a lack of creativity, an artistically bankrupt decision to force an upsetting moment into a subplot that doesn\\u2019t need it.\\n\\nIt didn\\u2019t help that this came on the heels of the previous season\\u2019s highly criticized sex scene between Cersei and Jaime in the Sept of Baelor, where Joffrey\\u2019s corpse is still on display for the traditional period of mourning. In that episode, Jaime forces himself on his sister as she tries to resist him, Cersei eventually giving in.\\n\\nOn a macro level, it\\u2019s not hard to discern the intention here. Cersei and Jaime maintain a codependent and mutually abusive relationship rooted in the narcissistic belief that their twinship makes them two halves of the same person. They are grieving the loss of their son, Jaime has been gone for a year in war, and they\\u2019re struggling to remember how to relate to one another.\\n\\nTheir creepy incestuousness hides many different power dynamics; Cersei and Jaime are addicted to one another, and have a tendency to bring out each other\\u2019s most selfish and sociopathic tendencies. In this scene, he\\u2019s forcing himself on her (something they\\u2019ve both probably done on occasion throughout their lives), while she\\u2019s struggling between the facts that he\\u2019s ignoring her pleas and that she doesn\\u2019t want to want to fuck at the foot of their child\\u2019s corpse, but nevertheless, part of her does. The addiction pulls at her. It\\u2019s a sick and abusive moment in a lifetime of sick and abusive moments for both of them.\\n\\nUnfortunately, the way it was filmed and edited makes all of this come across more as just rape than a complex intermingling of abusive awfulness. It didn\\u2019t help that many people involved with the show resisted characterizing the scene as rape. After all, Cersei clearly says no, and Jaime keeps going. It appears less consensual than intended, so it\\u2019s not surprising that the audience would walk away with a different impression.\\n\\nSansa\\u2019s assault could not have come at a worse possible time, given this context. An audience already weary of rape scenes won\\u2019t respond well to this card being played in such an unsubtle fashion, and they didn\\u2019t.\\n\\nIn the grander scheme, however, it was always important to consider the role this was meant to play in Sansa\\u2019s arc. A naive young girl seduced by monarchic pomp and then thrown into violent political turbulence, Sansa was passed off like a plaything through a chain of monstrous personalities: Joffrey, Cersei, now Ramsay. Even Littlefinger, with all his supposed affection for (and protectiveness of) Sansa, really was just reliant on her as a tool to fulfill his twisted revenge fantasy of becoming King of Westeros with Catelyn\\u2019s daughter by his side. But all of this is a precursor to Sansa reclaiming her own life and power. Her wedding night with Ramsay was merely one moment in a larger journey of becoming the true ruler of Winterfell.\\n\\nDoes Sansa\\u2019s naivete mean she was weak and therefore deserved this string of horrible events? Absolutely not. The purpose of this isn\\u2019t that she \\u201cneeded\\u201d rape and abuse to become badass or some other nonsense, nor is it to take away her agency. It\\u2019s that society devolved into chaos around her, and this is the path her life took as she tried to navigate the madness. These events hardened her, yet that doesn\\u2019t mean they ever should have happened in the first place.\\n\\nAnd in fact, her agency is not fully stolen. When Bryan Cogman said that Sansa chose this, he was referring to the fact that she\\u2019d made an active decision to marry Ramsay as a way to infiltrate Winterfell and eventually bring it back to the Starks. Baelish is trying to influence Sansa for his own interests, but at the end of the day, she is doing this for her family and for the North. What she and Littlefinger* did not count on was Ramsay Bolton turning out to be the Patrick Bateman of Westeros. Now that she\\u2019s in this dire situation, she has to find a way to stay afloat.\\n\\n(*This proved a subject of much debate at the time, but a rewatch of the fifth season reveals Baelish admitting that he doesn\\u2019t know much about Ramsay, and that this is a rare blind spot for him. In the books and the series, Roose Bolton mentions several times how he\\u2019s embarrassed by his son\\u2019s impulsive brutality, and on the show it\\u2019s implied that the full extent of Ramsay\\u2019s reputation is largely confined to the Dreadfort. Cogman has since clarified that Littlefinger indeed did not know the danger he was putting Sansa into, but the series did take time to acknowledge the confusion by having Sansa later refuse to believe Baelish\\u2019s claims of ignorance).\\n\\n2. Not only is it unnecessary, the scene is too predictable.\\n\\nThis criticism posits that Sansa\\u2019s assault comes across as rote and obvious, unpleasant but not revealing anything new about Ramsay Bolton or his intentions. The expected move is for him to rape and torture her, and that\\u2019s exactly what he does, undercutting the dramatic tension and rendering any suspense inert.\\n\\nLike the first point, this qualm is pretty cogent. One issue the series definitely had during the middle of its run was the cumulative effect of Ramsay Bolton and his misdeeds, which became four solid seasons of watching him do unspeakably cruel things and always getting away with it, a smug look of satisfaction on his face. After a while, his character and actions began to feel one note for many viewers.\\n\\nBut, while it\\u2019s true that one can see this incident coming a mile away, that\\u2019s also where the scene (and the ceremony leading up to it, filled with somber dread in the snow-dusted godswood) gets its power. You know what\\u2019s going to happen. And Ramsay knows, and Theon knows, and Myranda knows. Sansa has an inkling something unpleasant lurks in the near future, which is why the whole wedding feels more funereal than celebratory, her pale face stricken with a sense of foreboding.\\n\\nSome have dubbed this the Black Wedding \\u2014 partly inspired by the dark-colored wardrobe used throughout the scene \\u2014 a spiritual sequel to the Red Wedding. In the latter, the Starks were brutally murdered by the Boltons. Here, they\\u2019re being terrorized by the Boltons again, but this time through rape as well as psychological abuse, and in the place they once called home.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s horrible and devastating and unfair, by design. It\\u2019s meant to feel tragic, an emotional gut punch that doesn\\u2019t involve anyone dying or having limbs cut off, but soul-crushing all the same.\\n\\n3. This doesn\\u2019t occur in the book.\\n\\nAs far as A Song of Ice & Fire goes, none of this happens to Sansa. She\\u2019s off with Littlefinger under the guise of his nonexistent niece and learning from Baelish the finer points of how to manipulate people. It is her childhood friend Jeyne Poole, being passed off as Arya, who marries Ramsay and is subject to his monstrous whims.\\n\\nThe book version is viscerally even worse than the show, with suggestions that Ramsay coerces Theon to sometimes participate in his repeated raping of Jeyne, and that he\\u2019s forced her to have sex with his dogs.\\n\\nThe accusation is that the writers of Game of Thrones needlessly placed Sansa into this plot thread, when they could have just adapted what was in the novel and spared her character the humiliation. And of course, that\\u2019s technically true, but the argument of \\u201ccould have done ______ instead\\u201d is slippery, because any story could in theory have done something other than what it did. Game of Thrones could have not had Arya meeting Tywin or Brienne fighting the Hound (both of which don\\u2019t occur in the books), or it could have spared Ned and Cat and Robb their gruesome fates, or it could have replaced the Walkers with three-headed aliens who love breakdancing.\\n\\nAll that matters is what happens onscreen. Any of that is fair game. The rest is abstract and speculative and can only carry so much weight.\\n\\nThis argument also suggests that Ramsay torturing and raping his wife would be more acceptable if it were Jeyne, because we don\\u2019t know or like her as much as Sansa. That\\u2019s a fairly grotesque assertion to make in the name of treating the subject of sexual assault with caution and respect.\\n\\n4. Sansa\\u2019s assault becomes about Theon\\u2019s feelings.\\n\\nThe episode ends by pushing in on a close up of Theon, trying not to cry as he witnesses Sansa\\u2019s rape. Critics of the scene have frequently declared that this renders Sansa\\u2019s suffering secondary to Theon\\u2019s, milking her experience as a way to make him a more sympathetic character.\\n\\nHowever, a closer read reveals the subtext of the scene, especially in hindsight. It\\u2019s important to remember that, at this juncture of the story, Sansa still believes Theon murdered Bran and Rickon. She has no clue they\\u2019re still alive, so she despises Theon and lacks any compassion for his brutalization at the hands of Ramsay.\\n\\nTheon, meanwhile, has become so brainwashed and broken that he\\u2019s fully embraced his Reek persona, both psychologically and physically unable to tell Sansa the truth, despite the fact that she\\u2019s practically his sister.\\n\\nRamsay knows all of this, and is preying on these strained connections to torment both of them. It\\u2019s why he asks Theon to give Sansa away to him at the wedding, and it\\u2019s why he demands that Theon stay and watch the consummation of the marriage. Ramsay is torturing two people in this scene; the assault on Theon is mental and emotional, whereas with Sansa it\\u2019s also physical. (Though before this, Theon experienced plenty of physical abuse at the hands of Ramsay, including sexually. To say his abuse is not allowed to be a factor is, again, hypocritical).\\n\\nAnother aspect here is that, by slowly moving into a close up of Theon, we\\u2019re supposed to be hoping this is the moment he finally snaps out of it . . . where he will hit his threshold and intervene. And part of the tragedy of the scene is that he clearly wants to, but is so spiritually destroyed he instead just swallows the pain and forces himself to continue watching. In almost any other story, this would be Theon\\u2019s awakening. Instead, we\\u2019re tricked into anticipating relief and catharsis, only to have it snatched away.\\n\\nThere are also other, more practical reasons for not actually showing the rape and instead cutting to Theon. Namely, none of the producers wanted to put Sophie Turner through anything more than necessary to get this scene across, and there is absolutely not a chance in hell that graphically depicting her assault would have gone over any better. (Oddly enough, some remember this scene as more graphic than it was, which goes to demonstrate the power of a less is more approach).\\n\\nBut on the story level, this is a form of shared abuse between brother and sister, Theon knowing the endless parade of horror awaiting Sansa. It\\u2019s not about how much this hurts his feelings, it\\u2019s about how two people who desperately need each other\\u2019s help are worlds apart, even though they\\u2019re in the same room.\\n\\nAll of this services the larger story for each character. Sansa and Theon go on to form a familial bond they lacked as children, and help each other escape Ramsay\\u2019s clutches. In the final season, Theon arrives to defend Winterfell against the Walkers, giving his life in the process. Both his return and his demise significantly impact Sansa, who now truly sees him as a brother and as a friend she can trust, even pinning a Stark emblem to his corpse while she weeps over his body.\\n\\nTheon\\u2019s initial betrayal of the family who raised him is rooted in the same poisoned idea of masculinity which allows Sansa to be treated like a breeding cow. Feeling like neither a Greyjoy nor a Stark, and full of youthful cocky assertiveness, he tried to impress his birth father Balon by taking and holding Winterfell, failing miserably in the process and resulting in the deaths of Maester Luwin and Ser Rodrick, as well as two farm boys who are slaughtered and burned on his command.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s clear from the mere look on Theon\\u2019s face that he can\\u2019t live with his actions, but he moves forward anyway out of the sheer desperate need to prove to someone, anyone, that he\\u2019s a A Real Man. And this patriarchal bullshit not only ruins his life, but still fails to impress Balon, who shows he\\u2019s no true father at all.\\n\\nTheon is part of Sansa\\u2019s story, and she is part of his, and that fact is solidified on the night of her wedding.\\n\\nLittle Bird\\n\\nAll of this brings us back to Sansa, who\\u2019s come a very long way since that horrible night. She saved the Battle of the Basterds from a Bolton victory, fed Ramsay to his own starving dogs, out-Littlefingered former mentor Littlefinger, and now stands as more or less the ruler of the North, one of the savviest and most pragmatic political thinkers in Westeros.\\n\\nAnd then came her dialogue in the most recent episode, \\u201cThe Last of the Starks.\\u201d During Sansa\\u2019s conversation with the Hound, Clegane apologizes for not taking her with him when he fled King\\u2019s Landing. He admits to feeling responsible for everything that\\u2019s happened to her since. She in turns tells him that without her experiences at the hands of abusive men \\u2014 Joffrey, Littlefinger, Ramsay \\u2014 she might still be that same starstruck, naive little girl.\\n\\nAs expected, the internet went apeshit, the furor over the Black Wedding resurrected with one very brief exchange. In addition to thousands of outraged social media posts, numerous articles have elucidated the problematic nature of saying that rape and abuse can be good character builders.\\n\\nBut is that really, truly, honest to the old gods what Sansa (and/or the show\\u2019s writers) meant?\\n\\nTo be clear, she does take the approach of saying that her years upon years of nightmarish treatment did indeed help her become the person she is today. Being that she exists in a brutal, medieval-esque society where those with either social capital or physical strength often have their way with others who can\\u2019t defend themselves, it\\u2019s not surprising her comment here might have a Nietzschean edge to it. Westeros is a fantasy version of the distant past . . . it doesn\\u2019t exactly have people sharing #MeToo posts or Ronan Farrow writing explosive exposes.\\n\\nTaking that off the table, does Sansa ultimately mean that she\\u2019s grateful for the people who\\u2019ve abused and raped her and even owes them a bit of thanks for making her a stronger woman?\\n\\nNo. Nothing that Sansa\\u2019s done indicates that she\\u2019s thankful or forgives the people who\\u2019ve wronged her: she ordered and presided over Baelish\\u2019s execution, took pleasure in Joffrey\\u2019s death and anticipates enjoying Cersei\\u2019s, and, again, LITERALLY FED HER RAPIST TO DOGS (a fact about which she brags at the top of this scene). Those are not the actions of someone who\\u2019s full of gratitude for the time she spent with these people.\\n\\nAnother angle getting lost in the conversation about this episode is that Sansa is addressing Sandor\\u2019s feelings of guilt, which \\u2014 despite the fact that he\\u2019s doing his usual shtick of hiding his emotions behind the exterior of a callous asshole \\u2014 are deeply troubling him. He\\u2019s always felt protective of her, and his nickname of \\u201clittle bird\\u201d is as genuine in its affection as it is a taunting transference of his own self-hatred.\\n\\nBoth he and Sansa have encountered serious trauma in their lives, and they now share more in common than they ever have, so she does her best to assuage his needless self-blame. She doesn\\u2019t owe him consolation, but offers it sincerely, letting him know that she\\u2019s okay and that her ordeals were not his fault.\\n\\nThere\\u2019s also the simple truth that Sansa, after everything she\\u2019s seen, can\\u2019t bear the thought of ever going back to who she used to be. This woman has been through absolute hell and back, and has moved on. There is no recourse, no recompense, nothing she can do about the past; it\\u2019s inextricably a part of her. But that doesn\\u2019t mean everything she\\u2019s achieved is defined or owned by those travails. Sansa is more than the sum of her abuse.\\n\\nNearly all of the characters have been through the wringer and found themselves changed as a result, for good or for ill. If Sansa were discussing literally anything else \\u2014 a disease, drug addiction, the battlefield, fighting a monster, being lost in the wilderness for five years \\u2014 no one would think she was flippantly endorsing that thing as a path to self betterment.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s inevitable that a tale centered around an abusive male-driven monarchy would have parallels with our own world, where women have been subjugated and mistreated throughout much of history, and where a reckoning is currently underway in the cultural consciousness. The reality of modern sexual and gender politics cannot be dodged that easily.\\n\\nBut it\\u2019s also a disservice to demand that a character such as Sansa be used mostly as a mouthpiece or figurehead for what we wish to hear in the narrative of being a survivor, reducing her to a prop.\\n\\nYes, Sansa learned quite a bit from Cersei\\u2019s cynicism, Littlefinger\\u2019s snakiness, and Ramsay\\u2019s cunning. She in some way admires these certain qualities of the people who terrorized her, skills which helped keep her alive. Still, none of that is the same thing as dismissing abuse, or glibly accepting that rape is a fair trade-off for knowledge.\\n\\nIf anything, Sansa is using her power to make the North a place where the things that happened to her won\\u2019t happen to other people.\\n\\nAuthor\\u2019s full disclosure: Part of the reason this is such an involved topic for me is that I have experienced my own share of abuse, and have also been sexually assaulted. It\\u2019s taken years of guilt, blame, and denial to recognize and unpack what happened. Beyond that, some of the people closest to me have been brutalized by real-life Ramsay Boltons, those individuals who feel no remorse and are allowed to get away with their behavior without a care in the world. The reality of abuse, and the lifelong fallout it causes, hang heavily over my world.\\n\\nYet to expect that all survivors are uniform in how we process what\\u2019s happened to us does us no favors. That also applies to entertainment which might grapple with these issues in a messy or imperfect way, maybe even intentionally so. To be perfectly frank, it\\u2019s misguided, condescending, and reductive to assume that just because Game of Thrones presents an especially unsettling treatment of rape that all people who\\u2019ve experienced rape must therefore have the same exact response or interpretation.\\n\\nBy no means is this meant to disparage those who feel put off or negatively impacted by the show\\u2019s choices. Those reactions need to be heard and taken seriously if we want to continue the work of social introspection so integral to, well, breaking the wheel.\\n\\nThe other side of this particular sword is that we live in a culture of 24/7 media scrutiny, fueled by reactionary hot takes and the need to cultivate an intriguing narrative of conflict and indignation so that websites can generate revenue. The function of social media visibility and the climate of modern criticism demand an immediate, easily packaged opinion that will result in clicks, shares, and likes, and nothing guarantees those more than outrage.\\n\\nIn that web of supply and demand, it becomes more difficult to discuss the series\\u2019 treatment of certain subject matter, because the criticism and analyses find themselves ground into a homogeneous pulp declaring that Show X Has a Y Problem. The voices of survivors who found something positive or meaningful are drowned out in the accepted narrative that the thing in question is objectively, inarguably bad, a position which hijacks the voices of those very survivors.\\n\\nTo return to the Black Wedding, this scene may have been treated with more acceptance had been it not been saddled with the show\\u2019s prior depictions of abuse, or the unavoidable Ramsay Bolton fatigue settling in at the time. A closer look suggests that it unfolds quite purposefully the way it\\u2019s meant to. This isn\\u2019t Jaime/Cersei in the Sept, awkwardly filmed and further hampered by clumsy and contradictory statements from the producers about their intentions. Everything here is handled in a very intentional manner, whether or not viewers find it agreeable.\\n\\nEven if Sansa\\u2019s wedding night or her moment with the Hound never find any critical reevaluation down the line, her storyline will remain primarily one of empowerment. Sansa Stark is flawed and vulnerable and scarred, like any other character in Westeros. But in the end, her spirit remains more resonant than ever. Unbowed, unbent.\\n\\nAnd unbroken.\", \"row_index\": 36157, \"stack_trace\": \"NoneType: None\\n\"}\n"

The Scarborough Rapes (1987\\u20131990)\\n\\nPaul Bernardo was a suave, intelligent, good-looking man who was well-aware of his popularity and boyish charm. Paul found it easy to converse with and get into relationships with gorgeous women. There was just one problem.\\n\\nHe found simple, sweet relationships way too boring. Conventional, \\u201cvanilla\\u201d intercourse just didn't do it for him. In order for him to find pleasure, he needed his girlfriends to do things they didn't like. He wanted to hurt, demean, and humiliate them. Their fear was the only thing that truly excited him.\\n\\nPaul soon realized that it was too risky to continue having his violent outbursts with his girlfriends. The only way he could satiate his need for control was by violating strangers \\u2014 unfortunate women who would never know his identity.\\n\\nIn May 1987, Paul began sexually assaulting women in Scarborough, a suburb of Toronto. His M.O was waiting at bus shelters around night time, following women home, and raping them while intimidating them with a knife.\\n\\nOne thing that stood out in his execution of these awful crimes, was that Paul Bernardo didn't hurry. He took his time.\\n\\nHe was confident and vicious in his attacks and didn't stop until he had had enough. By May 1990, he had committed 17 sexual assaults that we know of, and came to be called \\u2018The Scarborough Rapist\\u2019.\\n\\nWhile these assaults began months before he met Karla, meeting her changed things. Paul had opened up to his new lover and shared his disturbing fantasies with her. Contrary to fearing him or retreating, Karla Homolka found these fantasies invigorating.\\n\\nTo her, this was a welcome change from all the \\u201cboring\\u201d men she met. She had finally found a man who challenged her and matched her own level of dominance and desire. Karla gave Paul her unconditional support, which just amped up the degree of violence his crimes involved.\\n\\nTogether they would not only rape but also brutally murder three unsuspecting young women, one of whom was Karla\\u2019s own sister, Tammy.\\n\\n2. The Murder of Tammy Homolka (December 1990)\\n\\nOn an ill-fated Christmas Eve, Paul and Karla gleefully recorded their family members having a cheery time \\u2014 Karla\\u2019s mother Dorothy cooking, her dad Karl watching the news, while all of them drank eggnog and a few \\u201charmless\\u201d alcoholic drinks.\\n\\nIn 15-year-old Tammy\\u2019s case, however, it was not so harmless. For her, Karla and Paul mixed a Daiquiri laced with Halcion, which is a tranquilizer drug. Once Karla\\u2019s parents and other younger sister, Laurie went to bed, they were left alone with Tammy, who passed out on the couch.\\n\\nTo be extra sure that Tammy wouldn't stir, Karla used Halothane, an anesthetic chemical that helps put animals to sleep. Karla had easy access to these substances since she was working as a vet technician in an animal clinic.\\n\\nTogether, they undressed and took turns violating Tammy as they videotaped it all. I do not wish to get into the sordid details that would be nauseating for any decent human being, let alone those with sisters. What makes it all the more sickening is the reason they did this horrendous act.\\n\\nPaul had been angered by the fact that Karla wasn't a virgin when they met. He demanded that she serve Tammy to him as a sacrifice to make up for this \\u201cgrievance\\u201d, which Karla promptly did. Sadly, Tammy began vomiting, and although they called an ambulance shortly after, she could not be revived.\\n\\nWhen asked about the chemical burn on her face, Karla and Paul lied saying it was a mark from dragging her across the rug, when they tried to resuscitate her.\\n\\nDespite their story being suspicious, Tammy\\u2019s death was ruled as an accident and the official cause of death was that she had choked on her own vomit.\\n\\n3. The Murder of Leslie Mahaffy (June 1991)\\n\\nLeslie Mahaffy was a 14-year-old girl who was in the wrong place at the wrong time. After returning from the wake of a good friend at 2 A.M, Leslie was dismayed to find that she had been locked out of her house, for missing curfew.\\n\\nAlthough Leslie\\u2019s parents couldn't have intended this as something more than a way to discipline their \\u201crebellious\\u201d daughter, this lead to her dreadfully tragic murder.\\n\\nPaul Bernardo lured the girl into his car and forcefully took her back to his house that he shared with Karla. He woke a sleeping Karla to excitedly inform her of his new quest, and then went back down to torture Leslie.\\n\\nKarla inquisitively watched Leslie from the top of the stairway. And being the ever-supportive \\u201ccool girl\\u201d that she was, she merely went back to sleep. In the morning, when she woke up to walk their dog, she was annoyed to see two of their finest champagne glasses from France.\\n\\nIt is important to note that she was not agitated by the fact that poor Leslie was still being tortured. No. Karla Homolka was more infuriated and jealous that Paul had whipped out their best champagne flutes.\\n\\nThe pair violated Leslie in unspeakable ways as they got it all on tape. Her exact cause of death is unclear, but it was later revealed that Paul and Karla thought that she should be killed because her blindfold had allegedly slipped.\\n\\nLeslie was murdered, dismembered with a circular saw, and her body parts were thrown into Lake Gibson after being sealed in cement blocks. The day Leslie\\u2019s remains were discovered by fishers was the day that Karla and Paul tied the knot.\\n\\nLeslie\\u2019s body was recovered and sent for autopsy, while not too far away, Karla and Paul had a lavish wedding ceremony \\u2014 blissfully basking in attention and delight, celebrating without a shred of remorse.\\n\\n4. The Murder of Kristin French (April 1992)\\n\\nKristin French was a 15-year-old girl walking home briskly from Holy Cross Secondary School. She was a bright, efficient teen who usually went about her routine like clockwork.\\n\\nPerhaps the brazen couple\\u2019s ploy wouldn't have worked if not for the calculating way they went about it. In the parking lot of a nearby church, Karla pretended to be a friendly, confused tourist, with a map in her hands, seeking assistance.\\n\\nKristin jogged over to offer her help, which ended in her abduction. Paul attacked her from behind and forced her into the car. Karla held her down in the passenger seat as they took her to their house.\\n\\nOver the Easter weekend, the couple tortured and sodomized Kristin, while recording their acts. Karla casually got to know her, chatting with her about makeup and boyfriends. Kristin played along, hoping that they would eventually let her go, but her fate had been sealed a long time ago.\\n\\nThis time, Paul and Karla did not blindfold or drug their victim, as Crown prosecutor Ray Houlahan pointed out at Paul\\u2019s trial years later. They were not going to just let her go, that was for sure.\\n\\nThey killed Kristin and left her body naked in a ditch, with her long hair chopped off. And then they coolly headed over to the Homolkas\\u2019 for Easter dinner.\\n\\n5. Karla Homolka\\u2019s Act of Innocence\\n\\nThe worst part of this entire horror is that justice was not fully served in the case of this cold, manipulative woman. Once Karla realized that the police were onto them in 1993, she did what she knew would get her out of this as unscathed as possible.\\n\\nShe perfectly played the part of a \\u201cbattered wife\\u201d. There is no denying that Karla had really been physically and emotionally abused by Paul. But, she shrewdly painted a picture of herself as just another one of Paul\\u2019s victims \\u2014 a \\u201cgood\\u201d girl who had unknowingly fallen prey to a deadly killer.\\n\\nKarla struck a deal with the Canadian government stating that she would get maximum immunity in exchange for her help in nailing Paul. In the end, she served a 12-year-sentence, which ended on July 5, 2005.\\n\\nShe is now married to her lawyer\\u2019s brother, Thierry Bordelais, and has 3 children. In 2017, she even volunteered at her kids\\u2019 elementary school in Montreal.\\n\\nPaul Bernardo is clearly no saint. He was a monster \\u2014 a truly wicked man who inflicted unimaginable pain on several girls. But Karla Homolka was no better. Anyone who gets to know the details of this case would see that Karla was equally responsible for these crimes.\\n\\nThe fact that Karla Homolka is now completely free enjoying a life of normalcy, is gravely disrespectful to those three young lives that should never have been taken. To me, this in itself is an outrageous crime.\\n\\nIt is a slap in the face of all that is fair\\u2014 a devastating pain that cannot be ignored by the girls they groomed, assaulted, and abused together.\", \"row_index\": 37721, \"stack_trace\": \"NoneType: None\\n\"}\n"

She has also been giving birth to their nine children for nearly two decades, and McGinnis managed to escape one day. It was almost a year before the authorities finally arrested the man she knew as the stepfather, kidnapper, and father of her children.\\n\\nBut thanks to a husband and wife who are observant of the oddities they see in McGinnis\\u2019 life, they quickly help her escaped after nearly two decades of torture. Finally, McGinnis was reunited with his family in Kansas City, Missouri.\\n\\nRosalynn McGinnis\\n\\nMcGinnis grew up in Springfield, Missouri, in a house only a few blocks from the park where she played with her siblings and friends. She studied violin because she dreamed of becoming a violin teacher, but apart from that, little McGinnis also wanted to be a veterinarian.\\n\\nPiette had lived near the McGinnis in Springfield. McGinnis said her mother, Gayla, met Piette while distributing flyers that were part of an environmental group activity. She said the two quickly became friends and ended up getting married.\\n\\nMcGinnis\\u2019 new life in Oklahoma quickly took a dire turn when Piette started harassing her when she was just ten years old.\\n\\nMcGinnis Was Forced To Marry His Stepfather In The Back Of The Van\\n\\nHenri Michele Piette carried out the kidnapping, and he tricked Rosalynn, who was 11 at the time, by performing a wedding ceremony for the two of them in the back of a van.\\n\\nPiette also forced her 15-year-old daughter to take on the roles of priest and witness. He married Rosalynn and even gave her a ring to make it look official. What makes this even more disturbing was that this unofficial marriage took place months before Rosalynn was kidnapped and only one day before Piette was supposed to marry Rosalynn\\u2019s mother.\\n\\nPiette first started sexually abusing Rosalynn at her home in Wagoner, when she was only 10/11 years old when he climbed into her bed and raped her.\\n\\nAnd at the same time, Rosalynn\\u2019s mother was also abused by Piette. After many unsuccessful attempts to escape from their home, Rosalynn and her mother finally moved and found a women\\u2019s sanctuary where they began to rebuild their new life. Unfortunately, their new life was short-lived, as that year, Rosalynn was kidnapped from her new school in Poteau and forced into the back of a van, with no hope of escape.\\n\\nThe Disappearance Of McGinnis\\n\\nAccording to documents obtained from the Poteau Police Department, a man picked McGinnis from school and drove off in a small gray car. It was January 31, 1997.\\n\\nAccording to McGinnis, on the day Piette picked him up at school, the man had dyed his hair black and was wearing fake glasses to disguise his appearance. Piette also went on to change McGinnis\\u2019 name several times over the years.\\n\\nOf course, her mother looked for her and announced in every media and Child Search Ministries immediately circulated missing person flyers with photos, age, and date of McGinnis disappearance.\\n\\nWeeks passed, and searchers failed to find McGinnis and Piette. The search finally stopped shortly before McGinnis\\u2019 13th birthday.\\n\\nMissing person flyers\\n\\nMcGinnis Gave Birth To 9 Children\\n\\nDuring the nearly 19 years she was kidnapped by her stepfather, McGinnis gave birth to nine of Piette\\u2019s children \\u2014 and none of them know what their mother went through.\\n\\nTo protect her children from the terrible reality and truth, Rosalynn kept her kidnapping and sexual abuse a secret. She raised them and suffered the abuse and torture she had endured. The children only learned the true truth after they managed to escape and be saved.\\n\\nThe Isolated Life Of McGinnis\\n\\nMcGinnis was 15 years old when she gave birth to her first child with Piette \\u2014 a baby boy born in the back of the van. At that time, they lived in a shabby little mobile house with weathered floors and no utilities.\\n\\nMcGinnis said she was forced to beg on the streets for food for her children because Piette squandered the money they raised on alcohol and drugs.\\n\\nMcGinnis said she tried to escape several times but, \\u201cwhen I was caught, the risk was much greater. Finally, at one point in time, it didn\\u2019t affect me anymore, because I got used to it.\\u201d she said.\\n\\nShe also said that Piette would always beat her with a rifle, baseball bat, wooden planks, and beer bottles. He shot her several times, and she suffered several fractures.\\n\\nMcGinnis New Hope\\n\\nWhile in despair because, for nearly two decades, living in gloom, a new hope was rekindled.\\n\\nIn early 2016, 19 years after she was kidnapped from the Oklahoma high school, McGinnis and her children met a married couple while living in Oaxaca, Mexico.\\n\\nLisa was a US citizen and her husband Ian was British.\\n\\nMcGinnis tells them her name was Stephanie, and Piette was named Bill.\\n\\nLisa later described the first time she met McGinnis at a local supermarket.\\n\\n\\u201cWe got in line, and they were in front of us,\\u201d said Lisa.\\n\\n\\u201cThey have two big baskets of groceries. One of them was filled with a stock of meat, which the children later told Lisa if it was all for Piette personally. And at that time, they could not pay at the cashier. They were short of money, so Ian and Lisa gave them money.\\n\\nLisa said that the McGinnis children hardly ever put on their shoes and the kids seemed hard to talk to. And they really don\\u2019t want to say anything to Lisa until the children get to know Lisa and her husband better. And they also know that talking to strangers was something forbidden in the family. When Lisa and Ian become friends with McGinnis and the children, Piette seems to be deliberately moving away by taking her family to move to a small, isolated village in Oaxaca's mountains. But Lisa and her husband managed to track them.\\n\\nLisa and Ian kept their communications going, until at last, one time, they visited the McGinnis family and got them nervous.\\n\\n\\u201cWhen we stopped at the car, children were hanging in front of the balcony,\\u201d said Lisa.\\n\\n\\u201c[McGinnis] looked really desperate, and I realized how remote they live. They are alone. \\u201c\\n\\n\\u201cAnd that\\u2019s when my mind changed,\\u201d said Lisa.\\n\\n\\u201cThat\\u2019s when I said, \\u2018Something\\u2019s wrong.\\u2019 We had to help them because something was wrong with this situation. \\u201c\\n\\nLisa called McGinnis, and after confirming Piette wasn\\u2019t there, she told her, \\u201cwe know something\\u2019s wrong. If we can drag your husband to jail or rehab, to drug and alcohol addicts, we\\u2019ll help you. And at that moment, Piette comes home, and we hang up. And that\\u2019s all I ever said.\\u201d\\n\\nThey Ran Away\\n\\nSeveral weeks passed, and one day, when Piette was unconscious with a hangover, McGinnis had the children pack some clothes and put them in a bag. They run away. McGinnis and her eight children had already fled and returned to the United States by then \\u2014 took a taxi and set off to find Lisa and Ian. But the couple had moved house, but luckily, McGinnis and Ian passed each other while he was walking the dog for a walk.\\n\\nLisa and Ian accommodate the family in their home. McGinnis slowly began to tell Lisa all her suffering. She said that not a day goes by without being beaten or raped or both. McGinnis also shared that her name was not Stephanie and Bill was not Piette\\u2019s name (when they first met, Piette introduced them as Stephanie and Bill). She told them that her real name was Rosalynn McGinnis. To her surprise, Lisa typed Rosalynn McGinnis\\u2019s name into Google on her computer, and a poster of missing persons McGinnis appeared.\\n\\n\\u201cI\\u2019ve been waiting all this time, and I have nothing to say. You\\u2019re the first person ever to notice that something was wrong and do something, and I\\u2019m very grateful,\\u201d says McGinnis.\\n\\nBack Home\\n\\nWorried that Piette will come looking for her and the child, McGinnis contacted the US Consulate in Oaxaca, who agreed to help. After a few days, McGinnis and her children got into the back of a fruit truck to travel for hours to the US consulate. But unfortunately, things weren\\u2019t that easy. When the family arrived in Oaxaca, the US Consulate could not help. Frantically and aimlessly, McGinnis again called Lisa, who then called the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) in Washington, DC. The organization searched for McGinnis\\u2019 name and saw she was still listed as missing. NCMEC told them to travel north by bus to Nogales, near the US-Mexico border. McGinnis d her children made a long journey. They then fly through Tucson and Dallas to be reunited with a long lost family in Kansas City.\\n\\nNews Of McGinnis\\u2019 Return Shocked The Family\\n\\nWhile McGinnis was excited about her newfound freedom, it wasn\\u2019t an easy transition for McGinnis and the kids in 2016. The family has very little money and was still adapting to US culture. Even for the little things, like adjusting to American food. It was also a struggle. But there was one other fact that burdened McGinnis. The fact that Piette was still somewhere free.\\n\\nAfter McGinnis\\u2019 story appeared in People Magazine in September 2017, law enforcement arrested Piette when he tried to enter the US.\\n\\nHe was extradited to Oklahoma, where he was indicted in federal court on one count of kidnapping and one count of traveling with the intent to commit sexual acts with a teenager.\\n\\nPiette was sentenced and also included a fine of $ 50,000, as well as a payment of $ 50,067 in restitution to his victim.\\n\\nFortunately, there was help and support for McGinnis from a young woman who has experienced similar trauma. Jaycee Dugard who also spent 18 years of her life kidnapped in California before being rescued in 2009. She opened the JAYC Foundation, which assists victims of long-term sexual abuse.\\n\\nMcGinnis and her children moved into the house they finally owned.\\n\\n\\u201cI want my kids to have a life I never had, including a house to live in,\\u201d said McGinnis. Meanwhile, Lisa and Ian also remain a part of their lives, keeping in touch with the children every week and discussing their days and future plans.\", \"row_index\": 62301, \"stack_trace\": \"NoneType: None\\n\"}\n"

Each of the stories made mention that Dean was the gay-for-pay stud of the moment. The dead porn star story plays out every day with very little thought given to it. With Dean\\u2019s All-American good looks and thick cock, he was not the average gay porn star. He played up his aww-shucks charm and came across as being accessible. Things wouldn\\u2019t end well for the hottie, but was it an accidental suicide as many have speculated or was it murder?\\n\\nMost porn stars use a stage name and Dean was no different. His birth name was Brandon Jason Chrisan. Dean liked to play sports, specifically football. He also claimed to have won fourth place in an Adult Body Training competition, though there is nothing to back this claim up.\\n\\nPorn Again\\n\\nThe first paid porn scene came shortly after Dean turned 18, barely legal. The setup was cliched, then irresistible jock fucks the girl. However the clip was a sensation and he booked more work, with similar themes. And then the straight porn stopped.\\n\\nWhere demand for Dean dipped in the straight world, his look played well with gay men. Even though the money may not have been the greatest, a top in gay porn might make $200-$300 depending on some factors, he was working steadily. His fanbase grew, and he was the object of lust for many fellas. But it wasn\\u2019t all bareback sex and orgasms.\\n\\nAs most porn stars, neigh celebrities do, Dean began taking drugs. Nobody seems to know precisely when it began, addicts are generally pretty good at hiding it at first, but it soon became an issue. He was having trouble performing and even getting hard. When your erection is the cornerstone of your career, that\\u2019s an issue. The offers for scenes dried up, and Dean was begging for money to take an Uber somewhere or asking fans to buy him things on his Amazon wishlist.\\n\\nHit The Bottom\\n\\nAn enterprising producer realized that Dean\\u2019s bubble butt was a gold mine. Wanting to work or needing the money, Dean agreed, and the third act of his career started. Here\\u2019s where it\\u2019s not hard to imagine that the addiction got worse. A straight guy fucking an ass is one thing, most have imagined it at one point (even if they wanted it to be a woman\\u2019s ass they were inside). But being fucked in the ass is something different altogether. Even for those who like it, there could be questions about their sexuality and what it means to love having a dick up there. It\\u2019s enough to drive a person to not want to think or self-medicate.\\n\\nAfter the initial rush of press announcing he had died, the articles stopped being produced There was nothing else to report, or maybe there weren\\u2019t as many clicks on the article as editors had hoped. There\\u2019s always another twink, another jock to take his place. Yet there is something odd about all of this. Addicts die of an overdose all the time; usually, there are a few follow-up reports when someone dies. In Dean\\u2019s case, there has been nothing.\\n\\nSources have said that Dean actually died in September of 2018, and the obituary just made its way on to the internet in October. Given the shadiness of a drug addict\\u2019s life, it should not be discounted that this young man\\u2019s life was cut short because he owed the wrong person money.\\n\\nOr more menacingly, maybe he was about to come forward with his own #MeToo story. He had stopped working in porn at this time, and fans have revealed that he had started an OnlyFans page (again not unusual, many porn stars do this) to keep money flowing in. There were allegations about the biggest name in porn, James Deen. This would have been the perfect time for a hunk, a male porn star to come forward with his own story of being used by producers for their own amusement. It\\u2019s not hard to imagine that someone would want to have bragging rights of saying they fucked Kyle Dean in real life. Especially an older man, whose reputation is built upon being with the youngest, hottest piece of ass around.\\n\\nIt may never be known what happened to Kyle Dean. His star was on the rise when his life was cut tragically short. Questions remain, but does anyone really want the answers?\", \"row_index\": 63241, \"stack_trace\": \"NoneType: None\\n\"}\n"

The colors of the changing sky and the mystery of everything around you. Even the little critters scattering around seems to be relaxing in their own right.\\n\\nMy boyfriend grabs my hand and pulls me off the trail. We giggle and climb a little up a mountainside; he turns to me with his signature \\u201csexy time\\u201d look. I laugh at him and think that he can not be serious.\\n\\nOh, and he was serious.\\n\\nHe gripped my hips and pulled me into him fast, and kissed me like he was not going to take no for an answer. Saying the word \\u201cNo\\u201d was not a thing in my mind at the moment.\\n\\nHis hands explored my body and slid under my clothing. My body began to heat up under his touch and the midday sun. I pushed myself into him and returned the favor. I unbuttoned his pants and got a good grip on what I wanted most.\\n\\nHe pushed me back against a tree and slammed his lips against mine. My leggings get pulled down just past my ass, and my thong gets moved off to the side with significant determination.\\n\\n\\u201cHoly shit!\\u201d His penis slides into me fast and hard like he is on a mission. He fills me so quickly that I don\\u2019t get a chance to breathe, yet I take it all. My face is an inch away from the tree, and my body is being slammed against it.\\n\\nHis penis was deep, his hands restricted my movement, and his teeth were digging into my shoulder blade like were on an episode of the discovery channel during an R rated matting week.\\n\\nHis animalistic moans match the sense of wilderness around us. I can feel an alien presence somewhere near me. I can\\u2019t look around. His hand is gripping my hair so he can focus on making this a quickie.\\n\\nI\\u2019m not usually one for public sex, but the way he was pawing at my clothes was a significant turn on. I let him make me his little forest nymph in a matter of seconds. I\\u2019m not sure why but the wilderness makes it so much sexier.\\n\\nI\\u2019m not sure what made me open my eyes, but when I did, I saw some gorgeous chick in a little blue skirt and black halter top pleasing herself next to a bush watching us. I wasn\\u2019t sure why she chose that outfit to hike in. Yet, that wasn\\u2019t the first thing to pop into my mind. I couldn\\u2019t focus on her wardrobe when I saw where her hand was.\\n\\nI could feel myself getting more wet at the fact this girl was fingering herself under her skirt to two strangers having sex in the woods.\\n\\nHer look was needy and sexy. She bit her lip and I could see her breathing was stifled by her arousal. It turned me on even more and I kept eye contact with her while I was being railed from behind.\\n\\nThe fact she was there was our little secret. I even felt the need to reach down and rub my clit, knowing she was going to town on hers too.\\n\\nI moaned louder so she could hear me, but she covered her mouth with her other hand, so he didn\\u2019t know she was there.\\n\\nWe came together. It seemed magical. He roared a little louder than usual while he exploded inside me, and I let it out so my little friend could hear perfectly.\\n\\nHe pulled out and fixed himself while I put everything back in place. I looked around to see her, and she turned back to me with a wink and walked off down the trail.\\n\\nI still see her face now and then when I please myself. I never told my boyfriend, but I try and fuck him in the same spot every once in a while to see if she comes back.\", \"row_index\": 74884, \"stack_trace\": \"NoneType: None\\n\"}\n"

It\\u2019s still Christmas eve and Ebony Scrooge, closed minded agony aunt, is expecting a visit from a ghost, as promised by her long-dead mentor. What can a spirit from the past teach her?[Part 1 available here]\\n\\nHer eyes weren\\u2019t closed long before they were opened again by the chime of her clock. As she blinked and tried to focus, she saw it was 1 am \\u2014 had she slept at all? She blinked again, noticing another shadowy apparition at the foot of her bed. This time it wasn\\u2019t Marley, it was\\u2026 Miranda?\\n\\n\\u201cMiri?\\u201d called out an incredulous Ebony \\u201cwhy are you here?\\u201d This night had started out crazy enough already and Ebony wasn\\u2019t even going to question why her college roommate was in her dreams. This was a dream, right? It had to be a dream, it was so surreal and nothing made sense.\\n\\n\\u201cI\\u2019m the ghost of Xmas Past, girlfriend!\\u201d laughed Miri. \\u201cI\\u2019m here to remind you of all the fun we had at University, and to get you to pull your head out of your puritanical arse. What happened to you? You weren\\u2019t always a stick in the mud, remember?\\u201d\\n\\nEbony winced as the memories came flooding back. Her scholarship at a prestigious University had pulled her far from home, far from her working class neighborhood, far from her family and her church. Without these anchors Ebony had drifted into a maelstrom of varsity life. It wasn\\u2019t quite \\u2018Girls Gone Wild\\u2019 but it had got crazy.\\n\\nLike her, Miri was there on a \\u2018diversity scholarship\\u2019 so naturally they were assigned the same dorm room on arrival. On a floor full of white girls, the only two women of colour, one West Indian from Brixton and one South African Londoner, got parked together, at the end of the corridor\\u2026\\n\\n\\u201cBy the Fire Exit!\\u201d laughed Miri, finishing Ebony\\u2019s thought. Their room had only been one floor up and the girls had quickly discovered they could climb out of the window and down the steel stairwell outside without triggering alarm. From there it was a mad dash into the local town, down some back streets, and across the cobbled lane to the Pig & Whistle \\u2014 a 200 year old pub where a girl could find a local lad willing to shout them a drink in return for a laugh and the hope of something more.\\n\\nThe girls very quickly became adept at scoring free drinks by dancing provocatively and playing the men off against each other. They\\u2019d sneak out of the dorm every Friday at 10pm, rush to the pub, to down as many drinks as they could before \\u2018last orders\\u2019 at 11pm. Of course the barman wouldn\\u2019t toss them out until midnight, meaning the girls could keep moving from table to table to help the boys finish their pints.\\n\\nIn the first semester they would wobble back to their dorm immediately after closing time, but in the second term Miri had cajoled Ebony to accept an offer from two likely lads to \\u2018come back to ours\\u2019 for another night cap. Ebony was wary, but couldn\\u2019t leave her friend alone \\u2014 they were safer sticking together.\\n\\n\\u201cSafer?\\u201d snorted Miri, \\u201cthat\\u2019s a laugh! And don\\u2019t rearrange your memories to put it all on me. You were just as naughty. I might have convinced you to go back to theirs \\u2014 but it only took one round of vodka shots before you suggested we all play a game of strip poker\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI did no such thing,\\u201d retorted Ebony \\u201cI proposed we play cards, because Phil was getting \\u2018handsie\\u2019 and trying to cop a feel. It was YOU who suggested strip poker to \\u2018make it interesting\\u2019\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cReally? Such selective memory,\\u201d snapped back Miri, \\u201cyou had no problem with Phil\\u2019s hands when he had you bent over his knee and was spanking you!\\u201d\\n\\nEbony shuddered at the memory, but it was true. She wasn\\u2019t good at poker so it wasn\\u2019t long before she was down to her bra and knickers. That wasn\\u2019t a big deal, she\\u2019d reasoned with herself it was no different to wearing a revealing bikini on the beach, but when she lost the next hand she baulked at what was expected. She might have been drunk but she was not taking off her bra. OR her knickers, which was what a laughing Miri had been demanding.\\n\\nSensing her discomfort, Phil had playfully suggested she pay a forfeit instead and, without waiting for an answer, he had grabbed her wrist and yanked her to him. In one quick movement he pulled her onto his lap, manhandling her into position over his knee.\\n\\n\\u201cPeople who break the rules need to be punished\\u201d he had said sternly, and suddenly he had brought his open hand down on her arse. Ebony was shocked \\u2014 she hadn\\u2019t been spanked since she was a little girl when her father had been angry with her for going to the park by herself. That day, her father\\u2019s rage had shocked her so she\\u2019d learned to be a good girl going forward \\u2014 but this was entirely different.\\n\\nShe was in a stranger\\u2019s flat, clad only in her lacy black bra and panties, and this brute had her laid over his knee and was \\u2018disciplining\\u2019 her! She struggled and squirmed but Phil was just too strong. He held her wrists with one hand as he slapped her butt with the other, and then\\u2013\\n\\n\\u201cUh huh, don\\u2019t stop\\u201d said Miri softly, \\u201cI was there sis, I saw what happened next too.\\u201d\\n\\nEbony gasped aloud as the full force of the memory came flooding back.\\n\\nUnable to break free from Phil\\u2019s grasp, she was at his mercy \\u2014 but he was showing none. He kept swatting her arse with his hand. She felt her cheeks getting hotter and hotter with every blow. The abrasive burr of his rough denim jeans rubbed against the soft skin of her tummy with every blow.\\n\\nShe felt the firm bulge in his pants as his erection grew and the hardness pressed against her. But most of all she could feel the wetness flooding her cunt as the heat spread from her red arse to her throbbing clit.\\n\\nShe was warm all over, the feeling was electric and it all seemed focussed on one point \\u2014 it was zeroing in on her clit. At the very moment that Phil decided she\\u2019d had enough and released her from his grip, as he delivered that one final blow to her ass \\u2026 as all that dark, unexplainable pleasure peaked in one final tumultuous wave. Ebony came.\\n\\nEbony felt like she\\u2019d been struck by lightning and twitched and convulsed on Phil\\u2019s lap as more waves of pleasure washed over her.\\n\\nBut the moment was immediately ruined when Phil, oblivious to what his spanking had done, concluded she\\u2019d had too much to drink and suggested it was a good time for Miri to take her home. So the pair made their long walk of shame back to the dorm. Ebony resolved, despite being sent home, that next weekend she would persuade Phil to take her back to his room where he could hold her down on the bed and fuck her hard as he spanked her arse with wild abandon.\\n\\n\\u201cYeah but you didn\\u2019t, did you?\\u201d interjected Miri. \\u201cYou got cold feet, you claimed we were never going back there. You said we had to focus on final exams and shouldn\\u2019t be wandering around town like sluts and whores\\u2026\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI wanted to be a writer,\\u201d countered Ebony, \\u201cI had a scholarship and I didn\\u2019t intend to throw away that opportunity on a few local boys. I could have had a dozen similar if I\\u2019d stayed home.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cYes Ebony, but if you want to be a great writer you should have something to write about. You need life experiences. Anyone can write a blog, anyone can be an Agony Aunt in a magazine, but to be a real writer you need to live life and write about that. That night I saw a spark in you that I\\u2019d never seen before. It broke my heart to watch you snuff it out so quickly\\u201d\\n\\nMiri took a step back, shaking her head as she observed Ebony pitifully. As she moved further into the shadows, Ebony realised she was leaving.\\n\\n\\u201cDon\\u2019t go!\\u201d she cried out, \\u201cdon\\u2019t leave me! Tell me what I should do\\u2026\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cGo to a fucking Sex Club\\u201d laughed Miri, her voice trailing away as she vanished into the darkness. \\u201cYou live in London\\u2026 there\\u2019s\\u2026 hun\\u2026 dreds\\u2026\\u201d\\n\\nAnd she was gone.\\n\\nEbony looked at the clock. It was five past one and yet she felt like she\\u2019d been up for hours. She pulled the covers over her head and shivered. She wanted to sleep, badly. Damn that cheese!\\n\\nContinued here by May More - also on Medium\", \"row_index\": 74921, \"stack_trace\": \"NoneType: None\\n\"}\n"

Monsters are most times created by the environment they develop in, the uglier the environment the more terrifying the monster.\\n\\nThis is the biography of a man referred to as the monster of the Andes, a monster created by his environment.\\n\\nEarly Life\\n\\nPedro Lopez was born on October 8th, 1948 in Santa Isabel, Colombia. He was born to Medardo Ryes and Belinda Ryes. His father was killed six months before his birth in a grocery store which had been attacked by a rebellious mob, this attack occurred at the beginning of the civil war in Colombia which is known as \\u201cLa Violencia\\u201d. Maybe if his father had been alive Pedro would have grown up differently.\\n\\nPedro was the seventh child among thirteen siblings and according to his mother, he was a polite boy who had the ambition to become a teacher.\\n\\nHow did a child with a dream to become a teacher turn into a monster?\\n\\nWhen Pedro was eight years old, he was kicked out of the house by his mother because she had caught him fondling his younger sister. He later blamed it on his mother because she was a sex worker who had also been constantly abused by her clients and probably witnessing those acts as a child affected him.\\n\\nLeaving home, fled to Bogota which is Colombia\\u2019s capital city where he joined a gang and began to smoke basuco- an impure form of cocaine. He was later approached by a man, a stranger who offered him shelter, young, afraid and probably hungry he followed this strange man and dissing the advice \\u201cnever follow a stranger\\u201d. He was taken to an abandoned building by the stranger and was sexually abused.\\n\\nStill thriving to survive, young Pedro turned 10 on the streets and he was picked up by an elderly couple who enrolled him in a school for orphans. This was supposed to be his breakthrough and a chance of survival for his victims but at the age of 12, he was molested by a male teacher which pushed him into running away, back into the street.\\n\\nGrowing up on the streets pushes people into a life of crime and that was the same for Pedro, he was arrested in 1969 for car theft. While serving his jail time, he was gang-raped by three of his fellow inmates this event had traumatized him deeply.\\n\\nHe got fed up with how he had been treated, and so he hunted down his abusers in jail and killed every single one of them his actions seen as self-defense by the local Colombian justice department not only that, he also earned respect from his fellow inmates.\\n\\nThings got worse after his release in 1978 because that was the beginning of his murder and rape spree. He began by abducting, raping, and murdering three young girls weekly by posing as a salesman who was lost and needed help getting out of the area, he would then lure them to a remote area to commit his crimes.\\n\\nBut during an attempt to abduct a nine-year-old girl from an Indian tribe he was caught. As punishment he was beaten and buried up to his neck by the natives, they had planned to pour syrup on his head and left to be eaten alive by ants.\\n\\nLuckily for Pedro, an American missionary saved him by convincing the locals to let her deliver him to the Peruvian police although they were adamant about killing him but were later convinced.\\n\\nSome reports say the missionary set him free at the Colombian border, while others say he was actually taken to the police who promptly deported him to Colombia without considering the threat he posed to society. However, the story goes the point is Pedro was let free to continue his raping and murdering spree.\\n\\nAllowed to roam free, he began traveling through Colombia and Ecuador, kidnapping, abusing, and murdering girls along his way. It was believed by the police and people that the missing children were being kidnapped by slavery and prostitution gang, of course, it was hard to believe that one man was monstrous enough to commit the crimes alone.\\n\\nDuring a flood near Ambato, Ecuador in 1979, the bodies of four among many of the missing children were found and days after that Pedro was caught by the mother of twelve-year-old Maria Poveda while he was trying to abduct her from a market.\\n\\nHe was arrested and detained for question although at first, he was reluctant to confess even after being beaten and tortured he soon did. Captain Pastor Cordova won his trust and confessed his crimes to him, he told him where he could find one of his victims.\\n\\nAnd that was how the body of Ivanova Jacome was found nude, lying on an old mattress in a cabin. When he was asked how many girls he had killed he replied;\\n\\n\\u201cOver two hundred in Ecuador, some tens in Peru and many more in Colombia\\u201d\\n\\nAccording to Biography.com, Pedro had a sick mentality that he was doing everything he did to help the girls, he killed them so they could go to heaven.\\n\\nHearing this, the president ordered that Pedro should be taken to the places he left the bodies until all victims in Ecuador were uncovered. At first, he was cooperative but knowing fully well that he would be charged for a murder he stopped and declared his innocence.\\n\\nAlthough the police were able to uncover fifty-three bodies and coupled with his initial confession, Pedro was only sentenced to sixteen years due to the Ecuadorian law for the deaths and was sent to a psychiatric hospital being diagnosed as sociopathic.\\n\\nOn the 31st of August 1994, Pedro was released from prison two years earlier on account of good behavior, he was deported to Colombia where he was charged with a two-decade-old murder upon his arrival. Instead of being charged with jail time, he was declared insane and was institutionalized in a facility in 1995.\\n\\nPedro was declared sane and released under a fifty dollar bill in 1998, after his release he visited his elderly mother. She claimed she had been scared and convinced he would kill her because he had blamed her for all his atrocities, but instead he asked for his life inheritance knowing fully well that there was nothing.\\n\\nHe sold his mother\\u2019s sole bed and chair to people on the street before he disappeared. Till today Pedro Alonso Lopez where about whether dead or alive is still unknown.\\n\\nThis is the tale of one of the most prolific serial killers in the world known as the monster of the Andes.\", \"row_index\": 81015, \"stack_trace\": \"NoneType: None\\n\"}\n"

      "{\"timestamp\": \"2025-04-10 04:04:28,423\", \"level\": \"ERROR\", \"message\": \"Received None response from model\", \"article_text\": \"The true Memoirs Of Geisha.. what few are left.\\n\\nThe true lives of these young Girls and Women as heavily appropriated not to mention ripped off by \\u201cMemoirs Of A Geisha\\u201d of the life of ,Mineko Iwasaki, who in turn created her own true memoir entitled \\u201cGeisha, A life\\u201d also carrying the title \\u201cGeisha of Gion.\\u201d The grounds for usage of the term appropriated is due to all would have been merely a novel had Golden not gone on an international radio claiming Mineko had sold her virginity (mizuage) for a \\u201cStaggering amount of money\\u201d followed by revealing her name in the Acknowledgements section of the novel in which he had promised not to do according to Iwasaki. Survivors of commercial exploitation, rape, etc I never recommend Memoirs to without a trigger warning because it more so tells the story of a Sex Trafficking survivor more or less just on the high class end not that of a Geisha. Albeit Memoirs covered the \\u201cPleasure Quarters\\u201d section of the day (brothels essentially) there was truth to it that pleasure quarters were often deemed for the \\u201cunfit\\u201d or undesirable for Geisha status. In fact Mineko revealed in her life story how she worked along side a Geisha who much like the sister of Chiyo (later became Sayuri in Memoirs Of A Geisha) had actually been sold into the sex trade in the pleasure district as a child. Her name was Yuriko. Much akin to Memoirs Yuriko\\u2019s Father had been a fisherman born and lived in the town of Suzushi, on the coast of the Japanese Sea. Like protagonist Chiyo of Memoirs her Mother passed away except not long after Yuriko was born this led into a series of unfortunate events for a child particularly during the war resulting in her Father committing suicide in front of her eyes following a haze of drunkenness due to the bankruptcy of his company \\u2014 which occurred a great deal to citizens during that time. Her stepmother essentially farmed her out to more relatives who utilized the child as a child labor before selling 12-year-old Yuriko to what were referred to as Zegen (Slave-Traders who went about the countryside seeking out to buy Girls solely for the purpose of selling them into the sex trade) ergo where the young girl found herself in a Pleasure District quarter by the name of Shimabara in Kyoto. This was where the high priced Oiran and Tayu\\u2019s resided (high-priced prostitutes and sex trafficking victims of the day.) They like Geisha practiced the arts however where they differed entirely was based on the fact they were paid for sexual acts as well as the reprehensible act of mizuage aka \\u201cdeflowering\\u201d a virgin sold at the highest bidder. Typically young Girls of Yuriko\\u2019s age or even younger in some cases. In this young Girl\\u2019s case she was eventually recovered by her horrified stepmother. The stepmother was able to intervene and have Yuriko moved to the Okiya in which Mineko worked as a Geisha. Goes to show the act of Sex Trafficking children hasn\\u2019t changed all that much anywhere since Yuriko and Mineko\\u2019s time. It has always been the same pattern of vulnerability, taking advantage of the disenfranchised, preying on high risk children and young people all to make a profit. If photographs were to be compared of Oiran and Maiko night and day life experience differed than what Geisha had. Anyone could tell they had really been through it not so unlike survivors of sex trafficking today. The sex trade is a horrible unfit world for human life, let alone children. It\\u2019s a degrading realm nothing honorable or empowering about it honestly.\\n\\nOf course in 1957 Prostitution was made entirely illegal in Japan. Which really declined the ever lessening practice of Oiran and Geisha as subsequently Geisha were grouped in with the Oiran as far as society was concerned. In present day there\\u2019s \\u201cLove Hotels\\u201d and I\\u2019m sure in home brothels somewhere but not much else. That\\u2019s about it as the price for prostitution and sex trafficking in Japan is high where law is concerned. Anyone caught partaking in human trafficking or prostitution will spend much if not the rest of their lives in prison. They have some of the strictest laws against it for valid reasonings. In fact back in 1998 a Woman was jailed for trying to sell her small daughter to a Geisha house. Needless to say no one else has done so since.\\n\\nWith that said Mineko did recollect on how in the practice of Geisha it really is the illusion of autonomy for those who are in that profession. So much so when young Girls would come to her in askance to become their Onesan she would refuse them. An Onesan is an \\u201colder sister\\u201d who takes apprentice Geisha referred to as ,Maiko, under their wing for guidance and sponsorship in the world of Flowers and Willows as it\\u2019s known as. She would state to these young Girls, \\u201cThe Nyokoba may be recognized by the Minister of Education as a specialized school, but it will not give you a high school diploma. No matter how hard you apply yourself you will end up where you started: with a junior high school education. You won\\u2019t have the academic credentials or qualifications to function in the outside world. Even if you do very well and receive a master certificate from the Inoue School you will not be able to support yourself.\\u201d Which is what led to her retirement at age 29 after years of trying to change the system in order to offer Geisha\\u2019s a stable life and future as they couldn\\u2019t be Geisha\\u2019s forever. Most retired in their 20\\u2019s and 30\\u2019s at the latest inclusively in Mineko\\u2019s day. Currently Geisha Houses lawfully can\\u2019t accept recruits who have not earned their high school diploma and what few remain will not accept any persons under the aged 18 even with a parental consent.\\n\\nAmazon Fire TV\\n\\nOf course now there are fewer than 1,000 practicing Geisha in Japan in what at one time numbered in the 100s of thousands mainly due to the vast opportunities available to Girls and Women. The artistic value is beautiful and one hopes it doesn\\u2019t die out completely but with the progression of our world specifically in this era of COVID we live in a very contrasting world than prior to. It\\u2019s undoubted that the remaining Geisha left are struggling more than ever as they can\\u2019t entertain clients. If a legendary Geisha as Mineko found the system oppressive in her day then it\\u2019s undoubtedly so by today\\u2019s standards.\", \"row_index\": 82487, \"stack_trace\": \"NoneType: None\\n\"}\n"

Logan is a young black male with hepatitis, and it is his\\n\\nsupreme mission to infect as many \\u201cyoung\\u201d males as he can.\\n\\nTHE MISSION BEGINS\\u2026\\n\\nLogan slowly opens his eyes and yawns as he begins to wake up. He rolls over to his other side and blinks a few times as he slowly rubs his eyes. \\u201cOh what time is it?\\u201d he says, as he leans up and looks at his clock on the dresser drawer in the other corner of his room. He then leans up as he begins to stretch and lets out another yawn. \\u201cIts 12:18 AM\\u201d he says as he slowly puts his feet on the floor and stands up awkwardly. He wears a size 13 and 1/2 in size shoe and he\\u2019s very very proud of his big black feet. \\u201cI gotta pee\\u201d he says as he clumbsily stumbles out of his room doorway as he heads towards the bathroom.\\n\\nLogan just fairly recently moved into the area into his new apartment, and so far he really likes it. He thinks that the area is very nice an quite when compared to the noisy neighborhood that he recently escaped from living at. He takes a nice long piss as he stares at his darkly yellow colored piss as he pees into the toilet. He begins to fantacize about the little VERY VERY CUTE long brown haired white boy that lives up the road from him. \\u201cGod i wanna Cum in him SO BAD\\u201d he says as he finishes up pissing and closes his brown eyes while he slowly strokes his Dick. His dick is his pride and joy, it is about 6.5 inches long and about 3.5 inches Thick with a NICE amount of brown foreskin on it and he loves it.\\n\\nHe thinks about the little boy deeply and intensely as he stops stroking his dick and shakes it a bit then puts it back into his black boxers. \\u201cIve gotta get alone with him somehow\\u201d he thinks as he looks in the mirror at himself then washes his face as he slowly dries off with a light green towel he has hanging on a rack. He\\u2019s seen the cute little long brown haired white boy walking along down the road by his apartment a few times with his dad walking his dog on one occasion, and then walking along with two of his older white friends on a few other occasions up an down the road.\\n\\n\\u201cI Bet those guys have fucked him before\\u201d he thinks as he sighs and turns off his bathroom light as he walks back down the hall while reaching back down into his black boxers to scratch his dick. Its not been proven, but he\\u2019s pretty darn sure that he might just have syphilis as well. He walks back into his room which is fairly messy, with clothes everywhere and an unplugged TV sitting on the floor next to his bed with about 3 or 4 brightly colored cups sitting on his small dresser beside his bed filled with water. He\\u2019s been drinking alot of water because he\\u2019s been trying to stay in shape, just in case he actually gets lucky enough to have Sex anytime soon with a boy, and he Really wants to Cum really hard inside of him next time he cums.\\n\\nHe looks at the clock on his dresser and it says \\u201c12:50 PM\\u201d and he thinks, \\u201cI WISH i could meet that boy walking sometime alone.\\u201d He often walks to the store up the road because he doesn\\u2019t have a Car or Vehicle of his own, he also lives off of dissability and draws a Check from the government every month, so money\\u2019s tight. He\\u2019s been looking for a job but he hasn\\u2019t had any luck with his searching, but he thinks that he will be in luck very soon. \\u201cI swear id KILL that lil boy if i ever got my hands on him\\u201d he thinks as he puts on his dark blue shorts and red faded \\u201cLevis\\u201d shirt. He slides on his black flip flops that he recently got from his Mom last christmas that happen to say \\u201cLifeguard\\u201d on them.\\n\\n\\u201cJust another Normal Day\\u201d he says as he lets out a big sigh as he grabs his cell phone that he has sitting on the smaller dresser drawer sitting next to his bed, and puts it into his right pocket as he reaches into his left pocket in his dark blue shorts and pulls out his brown snakeskin wallet. Its torn an faded, and was actually given to him by a friend\\u2026 well, sort of a friend. His friend at the time was a thief and would often go up to small stores and steal things and then bring them back with him. Logan really should have thrown away the wallet by now and got himself a New one a long time ago, but he didn\\u2019t have a job and even tho his Dad often helped him out Alot, he just couldn\\u2019t really seem to want to get rid of it. Plus he thought that having a snakeskin wallet was kind of cool.\\n\\nLogan open\\u2019s up his wallet and looks in and counts the money in it, \\u201cHmmm\\u2026 $6.35 cents\\u201d he says as he puts the money back into his wallet as he closes it and walks out of his room and into the livingroom. He looks at his livingroom window and see\\u2019s the bright sunshine gleaming through the long white blinds that were recently cleaned by him, but were still fairly dusty. \\u201cIts another Nice Spring Day\\u201d he says as he begins to walk to the door when the phone rings across the room.\\n\\nLogan pauses as he looks at the phone as it rings a second time \\u201cIts probably Mom\\u201d he thinks as he turns as he ignores the phone and reaches for the door knob. \\u201cI\\u2019ll call her back later\\u201d he says as he opens the door and heads out.\\n\\nHe steps outside and instantly feels the nice warm air as he walks down the driveway and onto the road, \\u201cJust a Normal Day\\u201d he thinks to himself as he walks up the road. He walks past two neighbors houses as a couple of dogs bark at him as he walks by. Logan reaches into his right pocket and pulls out his cell phone and earbuds that he also had left in his pocket from the day before and he quickly plugs them into his phone as he turns it on. He puts his earbuds into his ears as he begins to walk right by the house where his lil victim lives as he glances at it. \\u201cGod i Wish i could go into that house and Fuck the Shit outta that boy right now\\u201d he thinks to himself as his phone starts up.\\n\\nLogan looks at the screen and admires a really nice picture of his dick rock hard and standing fully erect. He took that picture one day while he was masturbating with a Sock over it and he though his dick looked so good he just had to get a picture of it just in case he ever wanted to Send it to someone. He quickly moves his finger to the Left as he scrolls through his apps to find his mp3 music app that he uses to listen to his music with and clicks on it with his right finger. Logan scrolls through his music folders and decides to play some of his DJ mixes that he produced himself.\\n\\nLogan calls himself a DJ, but he\\u2019s more or less like a producer because he produces music using loops and beats, but later he realized the difference between the two, but by then it was already too late since his online persona was known as DJ Logan. He chooses a Song and he\\u2019s off towards the store as he continues his walk, not knowing that today was not in fact just a normal regular day, he was about to give his DICK one Hell of a Workout Today!\\n\\nHe gets a lil further up the road and crosses the bridge as he stops to read some of the names of the people who\\u2019ve etched their names into the bridge\\u2019s steel railing. \\u201cI Bet someone\\u2019s jumped from this bridge before\\u201d he thinks as he glances over the edge and looks down at the train tracks down below. He gets slightly dizzy as he looks down below because he\\u2019s actually afraid of heights in reality\\u2026 he continues on.\\n\\nLogan begins to walk further and as he finishes crossing the bridge his heart almost jumps right out of his chest as he see\\u2019s his little victim heading his way\\u2026alone! Logan quickly reaches into his pocket and pulls out his cell phone and turns it off but he leaves his earplugs in his ears, \\u201cALRIGHT!!! This is my Chance, i gotta make this one Count!\\u201d he thinks to himself as he slowly puts his phone back into his pocket as his heart begins to beat faster as he and the boy begin to get closer to each other.\\n\\nLogan doesn\\u2019t know it yet, but the boy who is around 12 years old. Has also fantacized about him too, and has watched him go walking by his house on a few occasions everytime he heard his dog barking at him, and his lil heart was pounding too.\\n\\nLogan gets closer to the boy and he see\\u2019s his chance, \\u201cHey! Whats Up?!\\u201d he says out loudly in a very friendly-like manner as they get closer. The boy happily shouts \\u201cNothing much!\\u201d as they begin to pass each other. Logan has to think QUICKLY before he lets his one chance slip away from him, so he turns and quickly says \\u201cWhats your Name?!\\u201d hoping for the best. The boy turns and replies \\u201cBrandon!\\u201d and Logan replies \\u201cOh thats Cool! My Name\\u2019s Logan!, Where you headed?!\\u201d\\n\\nBrandon shouts \\u201cBack HOME!\\u201d Logan right then and there decides to go for it and take a chance and he says \\u201cOh thats Cool, mind if i Walk with you, i forgot my wallet!\\u201d (he figures, \\u201cHell its worth a Shot! The Worst he could Say is No\\u201d) Brandon (who just so happens to think Logan\\u2019s CUTE) happily yells \\u201cYeah SURE!!\\u201d\\n\\nLogan quickly without hesitating walks towards brandon and starts walking by his side. \\u201cSo where do you live Brandon?\\u201d He asks him. \\u201cI Live just up the road!\\u201d he spouts. \\u201cLogan can literally feel himself getting harder by the second just thinking about the boy. \\u201cSo do you like to walk around here all the time?\\u201d Logan asks him. \\u201cYeah i walk with my friends to their house\\u201d brandon says to him. \\u201cThats Cool, what do you like to do for Fun?\\u201d Logan ask\\u2019s him, (when he Really wants to say \\u201cHey, you wanna Fuck?!\\u201d)\\n\\n\\u201cI like to Play Videogames!!\\u201d the boy says while getting excited that he\\u2019s talking to his Cute new friend. \\u201cOh Really?! Thats Cool, I make Videogame Music!\\u201d Logan says. \\u201cREALLY?! Can I Hear Some of it?!\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cSure!\\u201d Logan says to him as he reaches for his cell phone. Then he quickly stops reaching for it and he thinks \\u201cI Shouldn\\u2019t let him listen to it right now, i can use THIS Chance to get into his House!!\\u201d Then Logan says to brandon, \\u201cI could come over to your House and Let you Hear some of it on my Laptop sometime if ya want\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cYEAH!! That would be GREAT!!! \\u2026id have to ask my Dad First though\\u201d the boy tells him.\\n\\nYou ever have one of those Days where it just seems like things are going your way, and EVERYTHING just seems to fall into place? Well Logan was having one of those days right at this VERY moment!\\n\\n\\u201cAwesome, i\\u2019ll tell you my phone number and you could call me when your Dad said it was ok.\\u201d Logan said to him, and Brandon replied \\u201cOK!\\u201d\\n\\nThey both walked a lil further up the road by an abandoned building and Logan thought about trying to trick the boy into following him into the back of the building. But then he thankfully changed his mind because he thought to himself, \\u201cNo i\\u2019d better not do that, he might yell Rape or he might run away and then id be screwed\\u201d and he was Right, the boy would have ran away and told his dad that Logan tried to Rape him in a broken down building if he\\u2019d tried that, Luckily FATE was on his side today.\\n\\nLogan and the boy brandon came up on his house and Logan said \\u201cIs this your House?\\u201d (Knowing full well that it was\\u2026) and brandon said \\u201cYeah! This is my House\\u201d and Logan said, \\u201cI could go get my laptop and bring it back up here and let you listen to some of my music if its ok with your Dad\\u201d Then the boy went into the house and then about 5 minutes later both he and his Dad emerged.\\n\\n\\u201cHey how ya doin? You the boy who makes that Vidia game music?\\u201d He said, and Logan quickly replied \\u201cYes i am! My Name\\u2019s Logan, nice to meetcha Sir, how ya doin?\\u201d as he extended his right hand and shook hands with brandon\\u2019s Dad, as brandon\\u2019s Dad said \\u201cRick! Nice to meetcha\\u201d. Now of course in the small redneck town that Logan lived in Logan Instantly thought that this guy was a redneck. But if he was, he was a modernized redneck, because just by looking at his home you could tell that he had money.\\n\\n\\u201cSo my boy says that you\\u2019ve got some of that vidia game music that you wanna bring over for him to listen to\\u201d Rick said, and Logan said, \\u201cYeah, See im a New DJ on the Scene and i make Videogame music for a program called D.R.E.A.M., and i use a DAW called a Digital Audio Workstation.\\u201d (he was obviously trying to sound as professional as he could be)\\n\\nThe boy\\u2019s father crossed his arms and nodded as he said \\u201cOh Yeah, how much money do you make doin that?\\u201d Logan put his hands in his pockets and said, \\u201cHmmm\\u2026 well i haven\\u2019t made any money doin it yet, but ive had like about 2 or 3 people download my music so far\\u2026. and i was wanting to bring over some of my music so your son could hear some of it and see what he thinks.\\u201d\\n\\nThen Rick says with a big sigh-like grunt \\u201cWell i dont have a problem with it but me and his mother are about to leave right now and i dont really feel comfortable leaving him with you by himself\\u201d (Looks like Logan\\u2019s Dick wasn\\u2019t going to get that Great Workout that he was hoping for\\u2026 at least not Today anyway.) But he responded very quickly by saying, \\u201cOh yeah yeah, thats cool i understand, i could just come back another time or something.\\u201d\\n\\nBrandon\\u2019s father slowly uncrossed his arms and put them on his hips as brandon\\u2019s Mom called for him to come to her for something, and said \\u201cOk, just do it another time when were home because like i said we dont really feel that comfortable with leaving our son here alone with a stranger, you might Rape him or something or Kill him for all we know, ya never know. You know what i mean?\\u201d and then Logan says \\u201cWell i totally understand, i\\u2019ll just come by another time then\\u2026 so when\\u2019s a good time to come back by?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cOh you can try back tommorrow afternoon, we\\u2019ll be home then\\u201d Rick said to him, \\u201cLike around what time?\\u201d Logan asked him. \\u201cTry around 11:30 or 12:00, we dont have anything planned for tommorrow so we\\u2019ll be home around then\\u2026 then you and him can listen to your vidia game music all ya want\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cAlright Cool, i\\u2019ll do that then. Im a head back home to my house now\\u2026 i was going to walk to the store to get me a soda, but i\\u2019ll probably head out later on\\u201d\\n\\nThen brandon came running back outside and said \\u201cDaddy can i listen to some of his music?!\\u201d and brandon\\u2019s father replied \\u201cNo were gettin ready to leave an he\\u2019s gettin ready to head back home\\u201d\\n\\nBrandon said \\u201cawww... come on daddy PLEASE\\u201d and Logan quickly responded by saying \\u201cAwww thats Ok! Dont worry about it, i\\u2019ll come by tommorrow\\u2026 then we can listen to some of it\\u201d \\u201cBye Rick! Bye Brandon! Cya tommorrow!\\u201d as he waved and turned around and headed down towards his house. He figured he\\u2019d call his dad and ask him if he could come by and take him to the store and if he didn\\u2019t get in touch with him he\\u2019d just head back out later.\\n\\nHe headed back down the road towards his apartment down at the bottom of the hill, feeling slightly embarrassed but also very very happy. \\u201cNow that i can go over to his house i can finally get my chance to be alone with him one day\\u201d he thought to himself as he arrived at his front door. \\u201cBut with his mom and dad around it\\u2019ll be really hard to Rape him and get away with it\\u201d he thought. Logan headed back into his apartment and he went about his daily routine. Things were looking up and he was as good as in, and hopefully soon he would be inside of lil brandon litterally.\\n\\nCHAPTER 2 The Mission Continues\\u2026\\n\\nThe next morning came and Logan woke up early, and i mean EARLY (like around 3:00 AM Early) and guess what the first thing he thought about was? Thats right, fucking lil brandon to death. He woke up with a Raging-semi and he played with his morning wood for about 5 or 10 minutes, the he hopped onto his computer to work on some more music. He wanted to work on some more music for his Fans and friends, (but he was also really working on a new Song for lil brandon) he wondered what brandon was doing around that time, and lil brandon was laying in his bed sleeping\\u2026 dreaming about being Raped.\\n\\n4:09 AM, Logan finished a very nice Song for his new lil friend and was very eager to let him hear it. OMG if you only KNEW how Bad he wanted to Fuck lil brandon you would be like \\u201cDamn Son\\u2026 calm down\\u201d He wanted to Hurt him so Bad he couldn\\u2019t even THINK straight, and somethin in him told him that it would happen Very soon, so Naturally he was excited. He saved his New Song onto his cell phone, climbed into his bed, put on some earphones and listened to it. Everytime he made a song he tried to listen to it like he was listening to it from a Fan\\u2019s perspective. So he listened to it, thought it was good, then he pulled up his Covers and went Back to Bed.\\n\\n7:19 AM, Logan woke back up and yep, once again he thought about lil brandon. It was like, if he didn\\u2019t Rape this boy SOON, he was Litterally going to end up Raping him in FRONT of his parents! He was Very happy with the new song that he made, he thought it had a Very Catchy Beat to it, and he couldn\\u2019t wait for brandon to hear it, (He hoped he liked it.)\\n\\n10:05 AM, the time seemed like it was moving SO Slow, it wasn\\u2019t moving Fast enough. He knew he needed to occupy his time by 2 hours, so he figured he\\u2019d Play a Videogame to do it. So he started up, a game called The Sims 4. He could never seem to play it long enough to really advance far enough into the game, something would always happen and he would either end up starting over or just end up quitting altogether. He started up a New game and created a young black male (who looked to be in his Late 20\\u2019s) and thought of him as being Brazilian. He wanted to see if he could get him in a couple of relationships with a few young boys and end up Fucking them.\\n\\n12:10 AM, it was FINALLY 12:00 and Logan breathed a small sigh of relief. He checked to see if he had his cell phone (Yep! it was in his pocket) and he grabbed his laptop, he made Sure he had a blank CD in the DVD Drive because he wanted to make a CD for his new little friend. He grabbed a bottle in the kitchen and poured some soda into to it, (Logan rarely drank coffee) and headed up to brandon\\u2019s house.\\n\\nLogan didn\\u2019t know it yet, but things were about to start getting GOOD. He walked up the road and the neighbor\\u2019s group of dogs barked at him once again\\u2026 he just ignored them, and he arrived at his victim\\u2019s house.\\n\\nBrandon\\u2019s large dog barked at him from within the large cage he was protected in, Logan\\u2019s heart rate was already up as his heart beated with excitement as little brandon opened the door as he loudly and happily said \\u201cHEY Logan!\\u201d as he turned his head and said \\u201cDad Logan\\u2019s here, can he come in?\\u201d\\n\\nRick came to the door and looked at him, (almost as if he already KNEW what Logan\\u2019s intentions were\\u2026) and quickly said \\u201cHey Logan, come on in\\u201d Logan smiled as he clutched his laptop as he quickly said \\u201cHey Sir, how ya doin? Thank You\\u201d as he entered the home.\\n\\nLogan totally felt kind of uncomfortable as he walked into the livingroom, (Naturally, because he was totally out of his element) \\u201cHave a Seat\\u201d Rick said as he motioned for Logan to sit down as brandon took a seat beside him. Logan was smart and fairly quick witted, so he instantly said \\u201cThank You, How you doin today Sir?\\u201d as he sat down beside his Tight, happy little victim.\\n\\n\\u201cGood Good\\u201d Rick said as he rested both his arms on his chair\\u2019s arm rests, \\u201cSo let me hear some of this Vidia Game music that you got\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cOk\\u201d Logan said, as he sat his cup down on the little wooden table in front of him and sat back beside brandon as he turned on his laptop. It was a Very nice house, he thought to himself \\u201cThis Guy\\u2019s got to be Rich or somethin\\u201d His laptop started up and he was SO glad that he changed his wallpaper from what it was before, (Two young boys, probably in their late 20\\u2019s Fucking, to a pic of Soundcloud, his Favorite Online Music Posting Website.)\\n\\nLogan could hear the sounds of someone washing dishes in the kitchen, so he easily figured that it was probably Rick\\u2019s Wife, Brandon\\u2019s Mom. He was right as she emerged from the kitchen to see who was there. \\u201cHey how you doin Maam?\\u201d Logan said as she walked in. \\u201cIm doin GOOD, are you Logan?\\u201d She asked. \\u201cYes i am, im an Online DJ, i produce Videogame music using beats from a DAW, a Digital Audio Workstation\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cOh Ok, how did you meet our Son?\\u201d She asked as she sat down in a chair across from him. \\u201cI was out walking and i came across him walking back home and i started talking to him\\u201d Logan said to her.\\n\\n\\u201cOh thats nice, do you know his friends?\\u201d she asked him.\\n\\n\\u201cNaaaw, i dont maam, im still fairly new to the area, ive only been living here for about 2 years\\u201d said Logan.\\n\\n\\u201cOh Ok, where do you Live?\\u201d (He should have known she\\u2019d ask that\\u2026)\\n\\n\\u201cI live right down the road from yall\\u201d Logan said, then realizing what he said was stupid, but then also realizing that it was the only thing he could have said to her.\\n\\n\\u201cOh, well he said that he met a boy yesterday and said that he wanted to come over and listen to some Videogame music, is that All you plan to do?\\u201d she asked him.\\n\\n(No, that wasn\\u2019t ALL Logan planned to do, he planned to Litterally Fuck the ever living Shit out of that boy) \\u201cYep! and i also might make him a CD while im over here, if he likes what he hears\\u201d He said. \\u201cOh Yeah, by the Way, Whats Your Name if you dont mind me askin\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cIm Michelle\\u201d she said to him. \\u201cIm Logan, its nice to meet you\\u201d he leaned up and extended his right hand and she leaned up and shook it and said \\u201cNice to meet you\\u201d\\n\\nLogan leaned back into his seat and said, \\u201cSo what do you do?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cIm an LPN at the hospital\\u201d she said, \\u201cIm actually late for work\\u201d\\n\\nLogan could easily tell that she was a Nurse by the way she was dressed in Scrubs. But he was just making conversation and said \\u201cOh, Ok\\u201d as she stood up and headed for the door, stopping to grab her purse on the counter at the door.\\n\\n\\u201cOk you Boys have Fun\\u201d she said, \\u201cBaby are you planning on leaving him here?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cNo he\\u2019s gonna leave before i leave\\u201d Rick said.\\n\\n\\u201cGod Dangit!\\u201d Logan said in his head as Michelle said \\u201cOh Ok, Bye Guys!\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cByeeeee!\\u201d they all said as she left, Logan definitely Felt as if his chances to get alone with the boy were easily slipping away. If he couldn\\u2019t make anything happen TODAY some how, it would be FOREVER before he got another Chance like this at brandon.\\n\\nRick let out a Big Sigh and said to Logan, \\u201cOk! Lets Hear it!, I gotta leave in 10 minutes.\\u201d\\n\\nLogan thought to himself, \\u201cDamnnnnnnn! I JUST Got here!\\u201d\\n\\nThen he said \\u201cOk\\u201d as he then began to Search through his Music File Folder for one of his Best Songs to Play. (He THOUGHT that it was allllll over, but things were about to start looking up in a VERY Big Way for him)\\n\\nHe played one of his Songs and even Rick agreed that it Sounded pretty Good, So Logan picked out another one of his Songs that he thought they\\u2019d like, and brandon was Enthralled by the music. \\u201cOh! That Sounds GOOD Daddy!!\\u201d he said as he hopped up an down in the seat, Logan thought he was just TOO CUTE.\\n\\nThen after about 8 or 10 minutes Logan said, \\u201cYeah i make music all the TIME, and im actually trying to get discovered\\u201d \\u201cI was actually planning on making brandon a CD while i was over here\\u201d\\n\\nBy then brandon\\u2019s father felt like he could trust Logan, because he gave off an Non-Threatining vibe to him. So Rick stood up and said with a Big grunt as he stretched \\u201cUnnnnnnngggh! Alright, if thats ALL you plan to do then make him that CD then Skidaddle, because im not really supposed to leave you two alone, but im about to be Late for Work so if thats all your gonna do then make it quick an get up outta here.\\u201d\\n\\nLogan felt as if the heaven\\u2019s were suddenly shining upon him, as he said \\u201cAlright! I\\u2019ll make him about a 20 or 30 Song CD, it shouldn\\u2019t take more than 15 or 20 minutes at the most\\u201d He said while in the back of his head he was thinking to himself, \\u201cHELL YEAH!!\\u201d as Rick walked towards the door.\\n\\nThen Rick got his Hat and said to Logan \\u201cHey No Funny Business with my boy alright?!\\u201d and Logan said \\u201cOh there wont be any funny business Sir, i promise!\\u201d\\n\\nRick then looked at Brandon and said \\u201cOk, im heading out for a lil while, so remember. After he burns you that CD kick him out ok?\\u201d and Brandon said Excitedly \\u201cOk Daddy!\\u201d\\n\\nHe got in his Truck and pulled off and lightiningly FAST Logan turned to the boy and said to him \\u201cCan i FUCK You?!\\u201d\\n\\nBrandon feeling suprised and Totally caught off-guard says \\u201cWhaaaat?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cCan. I. Fuck. You?\\u201d says Logan, staring at him Intensely, eagerly waiting for his response.\\n\\n\\u201cSEX Scene\\u201d LOGAN\\u2019S First Pound Session\\n\\nFINALLY!!! The Time Has Come! Logan was getting harder by the second and he knew he had to ACT FAST. Brandon didn\\u2019t know what to say, he was young, dumb, and full of cum. He looked at Logan like a Deer in the Headlights and slowly nodded and said \\u201cAre you Gay?\\u201d and Logan said \\u201cNo, i just wanna make love to you\\u201d then the boy said, \\u201cI dont knooooow\\u2026\\u201d Logan saw his chance and HAD to Seize it right then and there or it would slip away and he would have regretted it FOREVER! \\u201cI PROMISE it Wont Hurt, i\\u2019ll be gentle with you i PROMISE!\\u201d (At THIS point, he was willing to tell the boy ANYTHING to get in his pants) the confused boy began to look down trying to think and RIGHT THEN Logan made the move that ENSURED he\\u2019d get some Today. He quickly took him by the hand and said \\u201cCome On, Lets GO! I\\u2019ll make you the CD later i promise, this\\u2019ll be quick!\\u201d as he quickly led him down the hall and passed 2 doors.\\n\\n\\u201cHEAT!!\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWhich One is Your Room?!\\u201d Logan said almost frantically. \\u201cThe One at the End of the Hall\\u201d the boy said, \\u2026.\\u201dAre you goin to Rape me?\\u201d\\n\\nLogan had to think FAST and i mean FAST! He said, \\u201cNo, im going to make love to you very gently and massage your back\\u201d (I dont know why, but it WORKED!)\\n\\nThey entered the Room and Logan quickly shut the door and THREW off his Shirt as he then quickly walked up to the boy and took off his shirt and tossed it aside. \\u201cI dont feel right\\u201d said the boy, \\u201cThis is Gay\\u201d and Logan quickly responded as he leaned down in front of him and said \\u201cYou Like me dont you?\\u201d and brandon said \\u201cYeeeeah, but i think your trying to Rape me\\u2026\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cNo im Not, im about to give you a massage, now lay flat on your stomach\\u201d The boy believed him and quickly and excitedly hopped on the bed while Logan took his pants off as he said \\u201cHere we\\u2019ll take your pants off to make it Feel even Better!\\u201d\\n\\nThen he took his pants off and the boy looked afraid so he did the only thing he could think of to calmn him down\\u2026. he Tickled him!\\n\\nThe boy laughed and swayed his lil head from side to side\\u2026. he just so happened to be\\u2026. TICKLELISH! Logan used this to his advantage and tickled him for a few seconds then he said \\u201cOk! Lay Flat on your Stomach\\u201d\\n\\nTHAT HEAVENLY FEELING\\u2026.\\n\\nThe lil boy laid on his stomach and faced him and then Logan \\u201cInstinctively\\u201d told him to face towards the other direction towards the wall. The boy did so and then Logan QUICKLY and almost Clumbsily Slid off his underwear and then he took each side of the boy\\u2019s underwear and in one QUICK motion, he pulled them OFF!\\n\\nThen he QUICKLY mounted the boy as the surprised little boy leaned up and started to say something but got cut off by Logan\\u2019s weight as he crushed him and they both laid there nearly silent for about a moment while Logan laid his Chin on brandon\\u2019s left shoulder as he took his big black Dick (That was already a Rock hard Semi at this point) in his left hand and positioned it right in front of brandon\\u2019s butt hole and began to slide it in.\\n\\nAhhh\\u2026 HEAVENLY!! Thats how Logan felt as he guided and pushed his big FAT Dick up inside of the boy, he leaned up and looked down at his little body as he PUSHED deeper and deeper until the tip of his head went in, the boy grunted something that sounded like he was trying to say \\u201cstuuh\\u2026op\\u201d Logan determined, pulled back a bit then pushed in deeper until his whole DICK was deep up INSIDE of the boy.\\n\\nThis is the moment that Logan had been fantacizing about and LONGING FOR! The Boy let out a moan as he spread his legs just a bit while Logan did the same on top of him. Logan reached under brandon\\u2019s armpits and grabbed his shoulders as he pushed his big fat Dick in DEEPLY.\\n\\n\\u201cOH MY FUCKING GOD YOU ARE SO FUCKING TIIIIIIIIGHT BABY\\u201d he said as he held onto him tightly as he continued to Litterally PLOW the boy. The boy let out a moan that sounded like both pain and pleasure as Logan began to Fuck him in a Body WAVE like motion going up and down on him as they both started grunting while the bed started to squeak.\\n\\nLogan could already Feel his Dick throbbing more and more as he fought back the Overwhelming Urge to Cum inside of the boy, as he raised up and put his hands to the boy\\u2019s sides and started pushing up inside of the boy while the boy yelled out whimper-like yelping sounds as the combination of the bed BEATING against the wall and the boy\\u2019s sounds turned him on more and more.\\n\\nIts been a long Time since he\\u2019s had it THIS GOOD! He was livid and Determined to MAKE this boy remember him AND his Dick. It was no Longer him and the boy, it was his Tool digging into the boy\\u2019s bowels with ANGRY Percision as he was Litterally Working his ASS Off to reach a Catastrophic Explosional Finale INSIDE of the boy.\\n\\nIf Little Brandon would have known, or been able to have Forseen ANY of this Coming he probably wouldn\\u2019t have got out of bed out of Pure FEAR. His little hands CLINCHED the bed Covers while Logan absolutely and mercilessly BEAT his little boy pussy up. Even All of the long Walking, Running, and Playing he\\u2019s ever done COMBINED couldn\\u2019t compare to the workout he was getting right now.\\n\\nLogan COULDN\\u2019T Hold out ANY Longer, he could FEEL IT COMING Now\\u2026\\n\\nHe reached up and grabbed ahold of some of brandon\\u2019s hair and he began to prepare him for the firehose that was seconds away from being UNLEASHED inside of his little victim\\u2019s lil body as he SUDDENLY Felt his whole Body Tighten Up. He Closed his Eyes and gave one last FORCEFUL PUSH and Let his Big FAT Black Cock Erupt and Filled the little boy to the BRIM with Cum as brandon let out a Scream.\\n\\nThey Both Raised their heads as they BOTH got Lost in the moment together, and then they both suddenly Collapsed onto the boy\\u2019s Bed Sweaty and Exhausted in a nice moment of peace and tranquility\\u2026\\n\\nMISSION COMPLETE\\u2026\\n\\nStay Tuned!!! There\\u2019s MORE To Cum!!! \\ud83d\\udc9e\\ud83d\\udca5\\ud83d\\ude09\", \"row_index\": 86331, \"stack_trace\": \"NoneType: None\\n\"}\n"

I know, right? Where have I been, living under a rock?? Not exactly. I was 5 years old when the film came out, and I was living in my parents\\u2019 apartment in Manhattan, where we did not have a TV, so entertainment came in the form of reading quietly, arguing less quietly around the dinner table, and the occasional outing to the Metropolitan Opera House. So, yeah. I\\u2019m a fucking snob, a New Yorker, and a feminazi libtard, and I\\u2019m here to ruin Groundhog Day for you \\u2014 or at least, I\\u2019m going to try my best.\\n\\n1993 was a while ago. Hair was big, greed was good, and women were a novelty in the workplace. Many of my favorite films from that time (watched at friends\\u2019 houses, of course) have, in general, not aged as well as their stars. Ace Ventura: Pet Detective, for example, at which I recall laughing my 11-year-old ass off, now comes off despicably trans-phobic and just seriously unfunny. Teen movies that taught me what to expect from high school, like She\\u2019s All That, have been skewered for making two hours of entertainment out of predictable sexist tropes like jocks trying to deflower virgins for clout, and nerdy girls who just need to take off their glasses to become hot enough to be loved. But Groundhog Day remains, to this day, a frequent topper of lists \\u2014 it\\u2019s a \\u201cclassic.\\u201d\\n\\nAnd it is classic. It\\u2019s classic the same way that workplace sexual harassment is classic. The same way that millions of women\\u2019s #MeToo stories are classic.\\n\\nI know it hurts to hear, but Groundhog Day is sexist as shit.\\n\\nOn Wikipedia, Groundhog Day is synopsized like this: \\u201cA cynical TV weatherman (Bill Murray) finds himself reliving the same day over and over again when he goes on location to the small town of Punxsutawney to film a report about their annual Groundhog Day.\\u201d\\n\\nAn equally accurate synopsis goes like this: \\u201cAn idealistic young TV producer (Andie MacDowell) finds herself stuck in a time loop on location in the small town of Punxsutawney, where her soulless predatory coworker (Bill Murray) sexually harasses her over and over again until she finally falls in love with him.\\u201d\\n\\nThe sexism in Groundhog Day runs the gamut from overt to covert.\\n\\nOn the covert side, it\\u2019s evident in the fact that Andie MacDowell gets zero opportunities to shine as a comedic actress. The film is well-written, well directed, and full of good jokes \\u2014 but Andie MacDowell gets none of the punchlines. Her role in the movie is to set up Bill Murray\\u2019s jokes, to deflect his come-ons with grace, and to serve as a vehicle and then ultimately a prize for his redemption story. It\\u2019s a thankless job, but she does it with a smile on her beautiful face, because it\\u2019s 1993, and she\\u2019s lucky to be here. For a female actor at that time, proximity to comedy was the best she could hope for. It\\u2019s really a sad waste of talent, because Andie MacDowell is fucking hilarious. (For proof, watch Ready or Not, a 2019 horror/comedy. She\\u2019s a riot.)\\n\\nOn the more overt side of things, Groundhog Day is full of blatant sexism, disguised, as it often is, as a \\u201cjoke.\\u201d These \\u201cjokes\\u201d start right away: in the very first scene, Bill Murray\\u2019s character Phil Connors dismissively addresses his female co-anchor as \\u201cHairdo.\\u201d 7 minutes and 4 seconds into the movie, he asks Andie MacDowell\\u2019s character, Rita, to \\u201chelp him with his pelvic tilt,\\u201d when she asks (strictly professionally) if he needs anything. Less than 5 minutes later, he asks her, \\u201cSo, did you sleep okay without me?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cYou\\u2019re incredible,\\u201d she replies, politely fielding his advances.\\n\\n\\u201cWho told you?\\u201d he quips back, once again making things sexual, for no fucking reason.\\n\\nEveryone agrees that Phil Connors, Bill Murray\\u2019s character, is an asshole.\\n\\nThe problematic thing is that this asshole has a unique advantage \\u2014 he is the only person who remembers previous iterations of the same day \\u2014 and he uses that knowledge to trick every attractive woman in the town into having sex with him, before setting his sights on the one woman who has better sense than to fall for his shit the first 10,000 times. The fact that the Punxutawney women he sleeps with wake up the next day with no memory of what happened doesn\\u2019t make it okay \\u2014 the same way it\\u2019s not okay to have sex with someone who is blackout drunk. (Hey, guys, the fact that a woman won\\u2019t remember anything tomorrow is actually more of a reason to keep your dick to yourself.)\\n\\nIf you watch the movie from Rita\\u2019s perspective, as I did, because I, like Rita, am a young woman in my early 30s who studied English in college and has worked in TV production, the movie gets a lot less cute real quick. Poor Rita is new to her job, and she has a stellar attitude. She gets along with the cameraman, and tolerates the talent even though he sucks and won\\u2019t stop hitting on her, despite dismissing her at first sight as not his \\u201ctype.\\u201d (They\\u2019re coworkers. No one asked him whether he wanted to bang her.) Her ideal man \\u2014 whom she describes at length \\u2014 bears zero resemblance to Phil Connors, whatsoever. Never mind all that! By the end of the day, she\\u2019s in his bed. They return home and to their shared workplace as a couple. Uhhh\\u2026. No. Just\\u2026 No.\\n\\nI saw Groundhog Day with my two pre-teen nieces, aged 11 and 14. I readily admit that we laughed multiple times, but I also found myself getting increasingly uncomfortable as I watched the movie through their young and impressionable eyes. At one point \\u2014 when Bill Murray\\u2019s character, Phil Connors is forcing himself on Andie MacDowell\\u2019s character, Rita, in his hotel room, after she has said numerous times that she wants to go home \\u2014 I actually paused the movie to tell my nieces that if they ever found themselves in a similar situation, the appropriate reaction would be to scream, run, and report the incident to the authorities.\\n\\nLet\\u2019s take a closer look at that hotel room scene:\\n\\nPhil has spent significant time learning enough things about Rita to make her re-think her original (correct) assessment of his character. He has squirreled her away to his hotel room under the pretext of showing her the room, which she agrees is \\u201cnice.\\u201d But quickly things escalate.\\n\\n\\u201cI don\\u2019t think we should do this,\\u201d Rita says, as he kisses her. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a little fast for me. Maybe I should go.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cYou have to stay.\\u201d He replies, encircling her.\\n\\n\\u201cI\\u2019m tired.\\u201d She replies, pushing him away gently. \\u201cWe can see each other tomorrow.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cTonight. It has to be tonight,\\u201d he declares, kissing her again.\\n\\n\\u201cLet\\u2019s not spoil it.\\u201d She says, laughing \\u2014 the kind of tension-diffusing laughter that women use to soften a hard \\u2018no.\\u2019\\n\\n\\u201cYou know I can\\u2019t stay with you,\\u201d she says, literally wagging her finger at him. (They\\u2019re coworkers. They just met. This is her first assignment.)\\n\\n\\u201cWhy not?\\u201d He says. \\u201cI love you.\\u201d\\n\\nThis is where things take a turn.\\n\\n\\u201cYou love me?\\u201d she says, the weirdness of this moment dawning on her in full force. \\u201cYou don\\u2019t even know me.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI know you.\\u201d He replies. And he\\u2019s telling the truth. He has spent countless days getting to know her; her likes and dislikes, and exploiting them, to get to this very moment.\\n\\nWithout even knowing the full extent of his duplicity, she is turned off.\\n\\n\\u201cI can\\u2019t believe I fell for this.\\u201d She says. \\u201cThis whole day has just been one long setup.\\u201d\\n\\nDing-ding-ding! Rita gets it. The whole day has been one long setup \\u2013 and a longer one than she realizes. The whole movie is one long setup. Phil is on a journey to learn larger lessons about how to be less of an asshole, a redemption story that unfolds over the course of thousands of days spent on loop in Punxutawney. In order to get to tomorrow, he has to do basic good deeds, like caring for a homeless man, saving someone from choking, learning how to play piano, and carving ice sculptures. Rita \\u2014 beautiful, smart, poetic, young, idealistic, professional Rita \\u2014 is destined to be nothing but his reward. Rita, who has already declared that she is disgusted by this set-up. Oy.\\n\\nOn the last fateful night of Groundhog Day, in his hotel room, Phil tells Rita, who is getting tired,\\n\\n\\u201cYou can fall asleep. I promise I won\\u2019t touch you.\\u201d\\n\\nAw, that\\u2019s sweet. He is reformed! He has become a better person, the kind that doesn\\u2019t touch women while they\\u2019re asleep.\\n\\n\\u201c\\u2026Much.\\u201d He adds, ruining the cherished illusion that leopards change their spots.\\n\\nListen. I get it. It was another time. Rape jokes flew back then. But they do not fly now. An entire generation of boys grew up on Groundhog Day, and countless movies like it. Those boys learned not to take no for an answer, because, after all, Bill Murray gets the girl in the end. Those boys turned into men who kept kissing girls who said they were tired and wanted to go home.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s 2020 now, and Groundhog Day has never been more relevant. First of all, we\\u2019re in a pandemic \\u2014 and many people have made the connection that each day spent loading and unloading the dishwasher at home has started to feel like a copy of the day before. But the similarities don\\u2019t stop there.\\n\\nSo many women, especially in the workplace, have been stuck in a Groundhog-Day-esque loop for far too long.\\n\\nNo matter how much progress we make, no matter how many female writers write movies where women do deliver the punchlines, no matter how far we advance in our careers, no matter how much we accomplish \\u2014 we still do not live in an equal world.\\n\\nEven after the #MeToo movement, even after the conviction and cancellation of high-profile serial sex offenders and harassers, women continue to be paid less than our male counterparts; we are underrepresented in government and in corporate leadership; we are far more likely than men to be raped, sexually harassed, and assaulted. The President of the United States (though not for much longer) is a man who has bragged about grabbing women by the pussy. He is a bad person, who has gotten as far as he has because of our collective forgiveness of terrible male behavior, and our collective willingness to root for an asshole.\\n\\nIn other words, women keep going to bed in 2020, and waking up every day in 1993. It\\u2019s like Groundhog Day. It\\u2019s not funny. It is, however, classic.\", \"row_index\": 106303, \"stack_trace\": \"NoneType: None\\n\"}\n",

According to a BuzzFeed News article of December 17, 2017, Ms. \\u2018haachu\\u2019, who worked at Dentsu, the renowned advertising company, constantly experienced sexual and power harassment under her boss, Yuki Kishi. The harassment, she claimed, continued even after she quit.\\n\\nhttps://www.buzzfeed.com/jp/takumiharimaya/hachu-metoo?utm_term=.sub2dJoed#.th2pLlJ0L\\n\\nAfter reading the article, I started looking for more information and postings of its kind on the Internet and Twitter. Harsh memories of my past came back to me. \\u201cMe too!\\u201d I screamed. I couldn\\u2019t stop myself from posting what I had gone through. I continued, attaching a #MeToo to every comment I uploaded.\\n\\nMy past and present as #MeToo.\\n\\nI don\\u2019t feel I am a victim anymore. I\\u2019ve been liberated from the environment that breeds such harassment, and I am living a happy life. But tears well up and fall as I write about my past: the torment, vexation, my immaturity then, embarrassment, then the feeling of liberation for having been able to express what I used to think I would never be able to speak about. I used to cry aloud in\\n\\nthe middle of the night, alone. Tears fall, even now, as I write this. I wasn\\u2019t aware at the time that the harassment I was experiencing was causing me serious stress. I only thought it was one of those things in life I disliked but had to endure: \\u201cIt\\u2019s a totally natural thing. That\\u2019s how the ball bounces. You have to put up with it, for yours is an otherwise worthless existence. It\\u2019s no big deal. Everybody is bearing it. You must too.\\u201d\\n\\nA \\u2018me\\u2019 inside talked me into believing so. But the kindness of many people around me, my own efforts in overcoming my trials and tribulations,\\n\\nand then the #MeToo movement, tell me it\\u2019s okay to admit to myself that I was then going through a long period of undue torment.\\n\\nBefore you read my #MeToo.\\n\\nThen, I was shallow. I lacked self-esteem. I was immature, pitiful and ignorant. All these shortcomings combined made it happen. That\\u2019s how I felt about it. Which is why I couldn\\u2019t talk about it in public. I well knew that if I said anything, I would only hear \\u201cYou asked for it!\\u201d In fact, I thought so myself, and was afraid that speaking out would only cause others to rub salt into my wounds.\\n\\n\\u201cYou\\u2019re to blame. You weren\\u2019t firm enough.\\u201d \\u201cYou\\u2019re being too na\\u00efve.\\u201d \\u201cYou had sex with someone you don\\u2019t like for your career? That\\u2019s despicable! So filthy!\\u201d That\\u2019s how many would think. I am fully aware of that myself. Still, I don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s proper for anyone in a hiring position, or a superior, to deceive those in a weaker position or demand sexual acts of them. Absolutely not. That\\u2019s why I decided to shout out \\u201cMe too!\\u201d\\n\\nExposure issue during my gravure model days Nude photos in magazines\\n\\nThe first time I felt I didn\\u2019t like being a girl was when I worked as a photogravure model. I was scouted in my hometown, Nagoya, in autumn, in my final year of high school. I modeled for photo magazines for ten years. There are more than 30 so-called \\u201cimage DVDS\\u201d of me.\\n\\nI continued modeling for photo magazines where I exposed some flesh. Then I played the leading role in Onna no Ana (A Woman\\u2019s Hole), a 2014 movie\\n\\nin which I played a love scene. In the same year, my first \\u201cIshikawa Yumi Photo Collection \\u2014 ACT 1\\u201d (Chikuma Shobo, 2014) was published. There I appeared completely nude. I was on the front cover of a magazine several times, although not a very well-known one.\\n\\nMy modeling career started with a \\u201cphoto session\\u201d I applied for in Nagoya. Soon was doing promotional work with my manager, who was also the president of the company, and eventually we worked our way into the Tokyo market. After several photo sessions, I was made to wear a bathing suit for some photos at the studio. I\\u2019d worn bathing suits only at the school swimming pool, but I was told to wear a bikini. I very clearly remember how much I didn\\u2019t want to. Still, I told myself that all the girls were wearing them at the beach, that it was no big thing, and decided on my own to meet the challenge.\\n\\nNot long after that, my manager and I went to Tokyo to do promotional work with some publishers there. Luckily, one immediately decided that they would take pictures of me for one of their magazines. In those days, this magazine featured nude photos of adult video models in its photogravure pages, but because they had pages of models in their swimsuits as well, I was to be in that category. My first visit there, and I was already going to be featured in the opening pages of the magazine! I reminisce and tell myself I was then truly very fortunate.\\n\\nI wore bikinis of different colors \\u2014 white, pink and such, a school uniform and a school bathing suit \\u2014 outfits that exposed very little, I\\u2019d say, as I think back. I didn\\u2019t feel any anxiety being photographed for what to me was work for a new magazine, and all went well.\\n\\nThe problem started with the next work.\\n\\n\\u201cWe have an offer for a photo shoot,\\u201d my manager said. \\u201cBut they tell me you\\u2019ll have to expose more. You\\u2019re not very photogenic, so that\\u2019s what you\\u2019ll have to do.\\u201d\\n\\nThat\\u2019s true. Only a handful of girls get the green light when it comes to being repeatedly featured in magazine gravure. That\\u2019s the way it goes. I wonder what was making me feel so desperate after only a month since my debut.\\n\\nI was mentally pressured then. I felt that if I refused, I wouldn\\u2019t receive any more offers. I am not very cute, and I thought the only way to survive was to erotically expose myself. And my manager needed money badly. That\\u2019s how I think now.\\n\\nHe strictly prohibited me from making contacts or becoming friendly with the staff and others in the business. Time after time, he kept telling me that I didn\\u2019t have the looks. Come to think of it, it was close to brainwashing. When I refused, he drove me into a corner and said, \\u201cDon\\u2019t you want to succeed? Is that all the guts you have?\\u201d As I kept losing self-confidence, he accepted more demanding offers. I think his revenue increased proportionately.\\n\\nI was paid 10,000 yen per day. It remained the same no matter how tough the picture-taking sessions became or how many DVDs got sold. 10,000 yen times the number of days worked. My manager never told me how much he made. \\u201cConcerned about money?\\u201d he would say if I mentioned money. \\u201cI take it you\\u2019re not too serious about work.\\u201d\\n\\nMy manager was the only person I knew in the industry. I couldn\\u2019t find out anything about going rates or working conditions in general. After I became a freelancer, I was paid for all I worked \\u2014 200,000 yen to 300,000 yen for a DVD (which is before I appeared nude in the movie). This translates to having worked for my manager for 5 percent to 10 percent of what I should have been making, for I made 20,000 for a DVD that required two days of work.\\n\\nOffers of work came every month, but my manager kept telling me I had to expose myself more if we was to receive more work. I was frustrated, angry at the incongruity, but in six months I was half nude. My costume changed from bikini, to underwear, to thong, to hiding my breasts with my hands, to semi-nude. My inferiority complex, about not being cute, made me accept the escalation as inevitable. I did put up some resistance, though.\\n\\n\\u201cI can do so much, but not more.\\u201d I can\\u2019t remember how many times I said that. But then there was an incident that made me feel it was useless to argue. I was told to bare my behind for a picture to post in a magazine. I had told them, in a discussion prior to the photo shoot, that I didn\\u2019t want to be showing my buttocks, totally in the nude. Surprise awaited me at the studio.\\n\\n\\u201cWe\\u2019ll have you wear a string-like thong,\\u201d they said. \\u201cWe\\u2019ll retouch the pictures and erase it afterwards. Don\\u2019t you worry. You don\\u2019t have to show your bare butt.\\u201d\\n\\nSure, I was wearing a thong while the pictures were being taken. But it was getting erased. My naked butt was going be circulated everywhere! I was shocked at the spurious treatment I was getting, and went crying to my manager.\\n\\n\\u201cSorry. My understanding was that you\\u2019d be alright with a thong. But I accepted the offer on condition that you\\u2019d show your bare bottom. I can\\u2019t say no now. Go and get your make-up fixed. You\\u2019re holding everybody up.\\u201d\\n\\nHe didn\\u2019t care about how I felt. He only told me to stop crying. There was nobody I could turn to, and the shooting continued.\\n\\nAgain I thought I was to blame, unable to get myself across well enough. When I reflect upon it with a cooler head, I realize all I needed to do was leave the manager and look for work I could do. But I lacked the emotional and mental capacity to do so. I had lost the power of judgement. Neither did I have the confidence to imagine I could do something other than what I\\u2019d been doing. I thought I needed only to endure it all, or life would end for me. I am not exaggerating.\\n\\nI did in fact try to quit several times, leave the company. But then I was told: \\u201cDon\\u2019t use the modeling name we gave you.\\u201d \\u201cDon\\u2019t accept offers to pose in bathing suits.\\u201d \\u201cOtherwise, you\\u2019ll be out of a job.\\u201d Such were the overbearing words I got in response. So it took me quite a while to quit. Besides, there was also the problem of unpaid compensation.\\n\\nThus began the negative spiral.\\n\\nHaving allowed myself to expose my body, however reluctantly, I realized I couldn\\u2019t just stop with a thong. I was sure I wouldn\\u2019t get any work offers if I didn\\u2019t bare myself as told. But I would then end up a miserable photogravure model who constantly exposed herself indecently. Marriage would be impossible for such a girl. I would have no children, no native town to return to.\\n\\nFoolish as I may have been, I thought in earnest that I had no choice but to continue or die. Because my manager took charge of all the work we got and lied to me about it, I thought no fault lay with the publishers. Not so, as I look back more objectively. They knew very well that I didn\\u2019t relish baring myself, but they made arrangements with my manager in a way that guaranteed that they, too, would profit. I was then a girl who couldn\\u2019t flatly refuse, and my manager took advantage of it.\\n\\nExposing myself on DVD\\n\\nAs if going down a slippery slope, my gravure modeling became more and more racy. After about a year, the company decided to produce \\u201cimage DVS\\u201d of me. Over the years, I made about 30 solo videos. Producing them was bitter work, really.\\n\\nA case in point. One time, while we were taking some behind-the-scene shots to appear at the end of one of the DVDs, my nipple was inadvertently exposed. This was to be cut in the editing, but no. A fan of mine saw it and reported it to me. In those days, at my company a model couldn\\u2019t review her videos. I complained to my manager, but all he said was, \\u201cIt\\u2019s already on the market. I\\u2019ll be careful next time.\\u201d I was furious, but the fear of losing a job was stronger, and I couldn\\u2019t say anything more.\\n\\nAs I expected, the DVDs that followed entailed \\u201cinadvertent\\u201d exposures of my nipples. I believe there was a hushed up agreement between my manager and the publisher about this. By then, I\\u2019d given up complaining. I told myself I\\u2019d already done it before, and that my next DVD wouldn\\u2019t sell if I didn\\u2019t do it again. I was truly afraid of losing work.\\n\\nBeing forced to act as a hostess entertaining business associates\\n\\nI remember some other bitter experiences.\\n\\nAfter I somehow managed to quit the company that first recruited me, I got to know a man who told me he would bring me lots of work. This man frequently called me to attend drinking sessions with his business associates. I went, believing he would think I wasn\\u2019t interested in working if I said no, or if I asked if I could go home before the wining and dining was over. Almost always, the trains had stopped running by then, and depending on my work schedule for the next day, I had to go home by taxi, which was expensive. I worked part-time to make ends meet.\\n\\nWhen I declined the drinking sessions saying I had part-time work to do, the man said, \\u201cPart-time work for what? Your modeling work should take priority over everything else. Otherwise, it\\u2019s meaningless.\\u201d Sensing that I couldn\\u2019t reply with a sour face, I smiled.\\n\\nAt the drinking place, this man would say, \\u201cIshikawa! Do something to make Mr. So-and-so happy.\\u201d This he would say in the presence of others there. And if I didn\\u2019t do very well, he\\u2019d say, \\u201cYou don\\u2019t have what it takes to be in the entertainment business. You lack the drive.\\u201d\\n\\nOnce I had to attend a drinking session to which he had invited a producer at a TV network. This was the pits. They took me to a hotel, as if it was the most natural thing for them to do. Two men. I was too scared to escape. I was put into the bathtub (there were three of us in there), and was forced to perform fellatio on them. I had to. I had no choice. I couldn\\u2019t think of a way to avoid it. It was two on one. I clearly remember the disgust and hurt, even as I write about it now. It\\u2019s nauseating. I feel sick in my mind and heart.\\n\\nThe pain and hurt of sex acts forced upon you remain etched in your memory. And I wasn\\u2019t even allowed to show my disgust. I did it, smiling. I remember doing it as if I was enjoying it.\\n\\nI know it sounds strange to say this, but I didn\\u2019t have sex then, fortunately. When the hostess duty was over, I left for home, feeling like I was escaping from it all. No work offers came from it. The man who said he\\u2019d give me work only used me to curry favors from the TV producer.\\n\\n\\u201cPillow business\\u201d (casting couch) scam\\n\\nMy worst memory is this.\\n\\nI literally fell for a \\u201cpillow business\\u201d scam. This was about ten years ago. A girl I met through gravure-modeling work mailed me: \\u201cI\\u2019m going to work with a big shot at Dentsu. I showed him pictures of what you\\u2019re doing, and he says he wants to give you some work. Can I give him your contact info?\\u201d I remember I was elated when I gave her my contacts. But this man was an impostor.\\n\\nThat I was duped by this man remains a terrible, shameful taint on me. He claimed he was the son and heir of a large enterprise and said he wanted to use me as a campaign girl. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a big job,\\u201d he said, \\u201cso, of course, there\\u2019s going to be some pillow business involved. You don\\u2019t mind that, do you?\\u201d I said no, believing him to be the man he said was.\\n\\nI engaged in pillow business twice. Once, when I was made to give those blow jobs, and this tim when I fell for a scam. I didn\\u2019t doubt the opportunity, coming from a friend. But she, too, seems to have been duped. If I had thought more calmly, I would have realized from the start that the whole thing was a hoax.\\n\\n\\u201cPillow business\\u201d is generally known as sex a woman willingly provides to get work or to enhance her career, and I had been led to believe I was doing exactly that. I came to my wits only after people around me told me it wasn\\u2019t \\u201cpillow business\\u201d I had done but \\u201ccoerced sex entertainment\\u201d. I hadn\\u2019t done it on my own accord. I\\u2019d been tricked into it.\\n\\nIn the first place, no company big shot would directly contact someone he or she didn\\u2019t know. When we met, the man said he\\u2019d run out of name cards. He even made me pay for the dinner and hotel saying he\\u2019d reimburse me. He called me at my parents\\u2019 home, where I was staying for a while, and said, \\u201cIf we don\\u2019t talk about the work now, you might as well forget it.\\u201d So I borrowed money from my mom, and took the Shinkansen to Tokyo. I strongly remember the words this man spoke: \\u201cI watched your DVD. You firmly communicated your ideas of the role you were playing. You came across to me. Repay your mom and dad\\u2019s kindness with the contract money.\\u201d\\n\\nI didn\\u2019t want to expose myself, but I did. I bore it. It was hard, but I was glad I didn\\u2019t give up. I had often caused my parents undue financial difficulties, but I could now pay them back, help them with the house loan, repay them in some small measure for all they\\u2019d done for me. I was a fool then, truly believing I could do that. I was so happy I cried.\\n\\nIn those days, I used to think that \\u201cpillow business\\u201d was a matter of course because I was born a \\u201cfemale\\u201d. I believed that sex was basically something women had to endure. This may sound untrue, but I engaged in the \\u201cpillow business\\u201d (I can\\u2019t call it a business, actually, for it was a scam) without much hesitation.\\n\\nSex with someone you don\\u2019t like is pain, but I had to put up with it. Moreover, the man had to enjoy it. That\\u2019s what I thought. That was me then, and I did my best at it. I couldn\\u2019t think with a cool head. I was totally numb to everything.\\n\\nWhen it was over, I went home to my parents. Although I believed the man, something made me look up his name on the Internet. I then found a website that showed his face and an article that told of exactly what had happened to me. Tears uncontrollably ran down my cheeks, and I told my mom everything. I again borrowed money from her, and she took me to a nearby obstetrics and gynecology clinic where I received a prescription for morning-after pills. \\u201cI had a vasectomy,\\u201d the man had said before shooting into me. I can\\u2019t forget my mom\\u2019s grieving face. \\u201cOh, why, my dear . . .\\u201d was all she softly said.\\n\\nAfterwards, I kept close contact with my friend who had introduced me to the impostor, and went to Shibuya Police Station with a man who said he wanted to help. The con man had been arrested once before, according to information on the website. And he had repeated the same scam!\\n\\nHis M.O. was to call out to girls on the streets, or to e-mail anybody and everybody writing blogs who aspired to become a TV personality. The message to the girls was:\\n\\nExcuse me for this sudden mail. I happened to come across your picture on your blog, which suits the image of a commercial film we are planning to produce. We are pressed for time, and would like to hear from you as soon as possible.[1]6\\n\\nAll the victims received the same message.\\n\\nThe police didn\\u2019t take up my case. Instead, they faulted me, saying, \\u201cYou provide sex to get work?\\u201d I went to report as a victim of a fraud. Why was I being taken to task? My mind went blank. Did they think I deliberately went to the man for sex to get work? I had sex because I\\u2019d been told that, if I didn\\u2019t, I wouldn\\u2019t survive in the industry. I had no choice. Why were they holding my feet to the fire before they listened to my story about a man once arrested for a crime? I just couldn\\u2019t understand.\\n\\nConfused as I was, I desperately asked, \\u201cIs it alright then to cheat such a girl? Dupe her?\\u201d No reply came from them. Their attitude of looking down on women made my desire to tell them what I thought they needed to be told shrivel like a leaf. \\u201cIndeed, I am the one at fault!\\u201d I thought to myself. So I decided to let it pass as if nothing had happened, and tried to forget it.\\n\\nWhy I want to say #MeToo\\n\\nPutting all this down in writing, I think to myself I\\u2019m really a fool. A level-headed girl would\\u2019ve chosen some other means to make the best of herself, not expose herself if she didn\\u2019t like it. She would have turned down attending drinking sessions. She wouldn\\u2019t have fallen for a con. But in those days, I let others decide things for me. I had forfeited the duty of thinking for myself, which left me open to schemers and frauds, who took advantage of me. People in this business say to me: \\u201cIt\\u2019s taken for granted in this trade, so put up with it. You looked like you were enjoying it. You allowed yourself to have sex with such a guy because your sensitivity is a bit off.\\u201d That\\u2019s a valid opinion. But I was feeling miserable. I still cry over it. Each time I see a gravure of mine from those days, I lose sleep. I couldn\\u2019t sleep the night before the photo shoots,either.\\n\\nThe police ignored my case, probably thinking these things happen because women are fools. Is that why we\\u2019re victimized, why these things keep happening? No. It\\u2019s because male superiors and men in hiring positions take advantage of women who want to work. It\\u2019s because they\\u2019re allowed to exploit the disparity in the power balance between the sexes. I was afraid of people knowing about my bitter experiences, but I wrote this, hoping there\\u2019ll be no more victims like me.\\n\\nYour body is your own\\n\\nAfter I hashtagged #MeToo, I felt it most important that I squarely face my own mind and body. That, I thought, would lead me to enjoy life more. To that end, I should:\\n\\n\\u2014 say \\u201cno\\u201d to what I don\\u2019t like\\n\\n\\u2014 stop thinking I\\u2019m worthless unless I use my body\\n\\n\\u2014 continue believing that new paths will open before me, even if I\\n\\nlose my present work (using my body)\\n\\n\\u2014 start thinking about what I really want to do.\\n\\nEnduring hardships is different from making efforts. I used to think they were the same. I grit my teeth and bore it. I did my best, wondering why I wasn\\u2019t getting anything out of it. Now I avoid doing what I don\\u2019t want to do, like making gravure DVDs that I can\\u2019t fully agree to putting out, having sex with someone I don\\u2019t like, or currying favors from someone I don\\u2019t much care for. I feel I have regained myself after stopping all this, and I feel great.\\n\\nOlder now, the skin on my face has lost its firmness, which worries me, frankly. I can barely keep the figure I used to have, which is the only thing about me that people have commended me for. I can\\u2019t say anything witty, and my acting remains ham. But I still get work, sometimes, and have enough money to get by. I live happily every day without having to \\u201csell my body\\u201d. I\\u2019m doing what I really want to do. People around me are good to me. My present manager, too. I\\u2019m not pushing myself anymore, enduring the disagreeable.\\n\\nI used to believe that I\\u2019d be rewarded for bearing hardships and making continuous efforts. But that didn\\u2019t happen. I thought my life would be over if I refused gravure modeling. That was a big mistake. All the things I did, which I\\u2019ve written about here, are tied to the activities I am now engaged in. I can now act in love scenes without any shame or compunction. In fact, I like baring myself in works I approve of. I am writing this because I have come to strongly believe that I need to speak out on the gender issue. Too often have I experienced instances where I thought men were being unreasonable.\\n\\nI\\u2019m happy now, living freely, probably because I braced myself to squarely face my past \\u2014 all of it. But I know there are those unable to do so. Many in this entertainment business, who received the same kind of mistreatment I got, quit. Some have killed themselves, loathing to be sex hostesses at drinking sessions. I thought of suicide, too, many times. To these girls, I\\u2019m telling all about myself to say it\\u2019s alright, #MeToo.\\n\\nOf course, there are many men who respect women. And there are men who are victims of sexual assault. I want to stand by all who are suffering from abuse. Your body is your own.\\n\\nTo suffering women\\n\\nI wonder if any of you are having difficulties not knowing how to deal with men who are causing you trouble, any woman tormenting herself for having been born a woman. If so, good riddance to the thought. Value yourself. Give yourself more respect. If refusing unfair treatment causes you to lose your job, surely new doors will open for you. Don\\u2019t knock yourself out. If you don\\u2019t like what you\\u2019re doing, say no \\u2014 right now. Even if your male superior lets you know he\\u2019s in charge, you can refuse. If you don\\u2019t, you\\u2019ll never regain your self-respect.\\n\\nIf you seek advice and you get \\u201cIt\\u2019s your fault because you\\u2019re not firm enough\\u201d \\u2014 don\\u2019t believe it. The \\u201cfirmness\\u201d that others say is just their pushing of the responsibility on you. Or you won\\u2019t be living as the person you really are. I decided to listen to my own voice. How do you want to live your life?\\n\\nWhat men should do when women come seeking for advice\\n\\nIf someone like myself in the past were to ask you, a man, for advice, most likely you would want to help. But I would like you to be careful with what you say. Your words can have an adverse effect, make a girl feel she\\u2019s being faulted. She might think she only deserves to suffer, think she\\u2019s no good after all. These girls have lost self-confidence and are prone to put the blame on themselves. So if anybody comes to you for help, tell them to think more highly of themselves. Stand by them and speak words of comfort to them.\\n\\nI\\u2019ll be happy if any victim \\u2014 female or male \\u2014 finds some solace reading this. If anybody is hesitating to hashtag #MeToo, I would like them to think about the confessions I made of myself. Writing this, as I cried my heart out, cut the chains of what had bound me. Hashtagging #MeToo can lead to healing painful memories. Take it easy, though. Never push yourself. I pray that what I revealed of myself will reach those who are suffering the pain I suffered.\\n\\nSome girls, in fact many, truly enjoy baring themselves in magazine gravure, and I think that\\u2019s great. But those who don\\u2019t like it should stop. Nor should they be told to do what they don\\u2019t want to do. I don\\u2019t intend to sue anybody with this tell-all story of mine. I seek no apology. I\\u2019m not interested in that. I only want all of you, who are suffering from mistreatment by men at your workplace, to know that it\\u2019s alright to speak your mind. You don\\u2019t have to endure it anymore. In my case, the #MeToo hashtag helped me do that.\\n\\nI revealed all about myself, not minding being disliked or losing a job. I\\u2019m not married. I have no boyfriend, no kids, no important work yet that I must do, nothing really that I must protect. But I am not alone. Many stand by me. #MeToo. And #WeToo. May the world be a freer place for all to live in.\", \"row_index\": 106343, \"stack_trace\": \"NoneType: None\\n\"}\n"

      "{\"timestamp\": \"2025-04-10 06:26:26,951\", \"level\": \"ERROR\", \"message\": \"Received None response from model\", \"article_text\": \"AN OBSERVATION ON THE DIFFERENT COLOURS OF REALITY.\\n\\n\\n\\nWritten by Festus Obehi Destiny\\n\\n\\n\\nBeing poor will make you so angry. Your emotions so taut. Your thoughts overwhelm you until you feel claustrophobic. Your freedom is not yours to give. Your lips are locked, emotions pocketed, until you explode in different drabs of depression. Depression keeps you angry and anger is the spice of poverty. Although many of us have mastered the art of introducing humor to our situation to make an euphemism of the hyperbole that anguishes our everyday thoughts. How gruesome it is to wake up everyday to a recurring state of disappointment, go out, see the life you are living, the life you are trying to avoid and the dreams you are struggling to sail in. in secondary school, we are indoctrinated to master the arms of government and the fallacy of the fundamental human rights. But reality is far different and disappointing. You realize that the average man in Nigeria cannot afford his rights or even use them. He is in a situation where rights do not function in his reality and it is only his pursuit of wealth, the pursuit of happiness, that matters. Even though he isn\\u2019t free to use this right as a collective, even as an individual, his hands are still tied. He lives in a crappy bungalow with seven other neighbors, sharing a bathroom too small for the average height and too slim to pick up a soap. He wakes up to the noise of the neighbor\\u2019s child at midnight scrunching for milk and refusing to swallow the dusty bit nipple of his malnourished mother. he can hear the banging of the neighbor by his other side and he cannot tell if the noise is the intensity of rape or is he just beating his girlfriend like any other normal Tuesday. His privacy, just like his fundamental human rights do not function in his reality.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhere I come from, you either pocket or unleash your emotion depending on who is seeking your attention. For many an example, when the grumpy landlord comes with his first born illiterate son seeking rent, approval, respect or an enactment of a ridiculous rule for neighbors unfortunate enough to stay in the dingy crooked apartment, your parents smile and nod their head. Of course they do not agree with whatever he says and they would rather not spend their Wednesdays on a very insignificant meeting, but they realize that they cannot afford to be disrespectful or even be honest with themselves. Any contradiction will offer them a quit notice and with the rising rate of houses in Lagos, one can say that the fear of rent in Lagos is enough to keep you silent. Your parents keep their anguish and anger for the little children who misplace their lunch money, forget to greet or even for the ridiculous reason. The slap meant for the oppressors will land on the cheeks of the unfortunate victims that dangle with the patience of the oppressed.\\n\\n\\n\\nAmidst the growing rate of poverty and insecurity in rural areas, one resources that never seem to be scarce is the children. The poor man works hard in labor in the day and gropes the skirt of his house wife at night. With no care in the world for family planning or the use of a condom, his wife\\u2019s stomach grows every season and small parties are thrown depending on the sex of the child. the children are thrown into the pursuit of excellence in public schools. Their intelligence is based on whose memory works the fastest. Indoctrination takes the center stage, religion keeps them in moral check and the cane is used to remind them of how good a citizen they are supposed to be. But even these mesh of love and torture doesn\\u2019t work forever. For as puberty knocks, growing questions surrounds their actions, thoughts and desires. Questions that the house wife mother cannot answer and the father is too ignorant or cannot afford the care to answer.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor a family that survives and not live {Because living is very different from surviving}, there is hardly anytime for a parent to sit down and discuss the boundaries and climax of puberty. Many of us were left to figure out the answers to our unexplainable bulging desires from the colorful pages of our biology textbooks, inquisitive neighbors and the friends who knew more they should. And so we embraced them all, myths, truth and lies. And when our desires overwhelmed us, we bade no concern to morality, rather we explored and desecrated the boundaries that separated boy from man, girl from woman, and a child from youth.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe years that comes make puberty look like a foreshadowing to the terrors that would later hunt our realities. For the boy, he begins to realise that he is treated and talked to differently. His choices are limited, his desires are franchised and his responsibility emerge out of the curtain as if they were invisible before he became aware of them. He realizes that his worth is tied to monetary value. The same way a slave is. If the family is very poor, the boy might not achieve his dreams of education and might be pushed into the streets into the world that embroiders the word \\u2018hustle\\u2019. He might scan the environment where he lives and try to adapt the same way that men that have come before him have used and succeeded. This might involve the legal or the illegal franchise depending on where he lives, who he meets and what he believes in. His lady counterpart, at the inception of puberty, comes with a fear as the body grows. It is hardly ever talked about the fear that comes with puberty. I do not mean the emergence of age but seeing the body that you once owned and control, grow out of your own control or thought comes with a slight scare.\\n\\n\\n\\nJust like the boy, the lady\\u2019s choices depend greatly on the family she is brought up in, where she grows and what she believes in. where I come from, we have a lot of poor families with ladies strutting after rich boys or men, exchanging pleasure for money. These girls see their elder sisters who have seen other sisters grow into puberty, explored boundaries and realized that they couldn\\u2019t cross back into the shores of morality unscatched. The shame, the consciousness and the realization of their actions keep them on the side of their choices until salvation comes, if salvation comes.\\n\\n\\n\\nAt night, the heat comes with a terrible haunt and hurt. And if you can survive that meandering fury, what tears into your privacy is the cries of the children. Not your own children but the ten or dozen children squabble that always erupt from your neighbor\\u2019s home. They say wall have ears but in your own case, the walls have holes in them. Gaps that age and rats have chewed fiercely and now it seems there is no wall at all in the first place protecting your ears from the squabbles and discordant symphonies that always erupt out of the night into your vulnerable lobes. I moan about these cries because with them arise the birth of a new terror, that is the day that your conflicted soul will face again, at least for a fleeting day. Then, I say again, with these children cries, comes the suckling, and fingers, scratching for food and attention. But of course the children surround and limp over an half empty bed with the comatose mother, sleeping and fading away. Today, you cannot tell if she is simply running from her own world or if she has just been raped again to a comatose state.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat comes next is the banging on your door. The knock of one who does not sleep behind the same doors as you but certainly owns the floor you sleep on. The fingers keep bulging and slashing until your mouth responds to calm the knuckles. And then you stretch your shorts, wipe the spittle off your face, twist and turn so that your legs do not kick against the teeth of any of your own siblings. You stand in for your parents as you see other parents with shrunken bodies and furious eyes, who have obviously endured the same nightmare of an evening that you have staggered through. Greetings are exchanged, rejected and spat. The landlord of course throws a tantrum about topics that you have condemned to your unnecessary folder. Words that you will receive and reject before you see your parents again at twilight to pass it on. You sleep through half the sermon and only jerk awake when the flies buzzing out of the toilet comes close enough to rest between your nose or sing choruses behind your ears. You catch the sleepy lackadaisical eyes of the other tenants and you can still hear the cries of the dozen children behind your rooms, limping and singing for a mother whose spirit is miles away from her torment. The only person alive this morning is the landlord punishing you with his authority, anger and a restless ego seeking to renew its worth by reliving its strength and tormenting the helpless tenants with a clich\\u00e9 Thursday morning. At last, the words end and greetings are exchanged, picked up and spat at again. You cannot recall if at one point, voices had been raised, tempers had been tested or threats had been issued, all noises now operate at a familiar frequency of disturbance, stress and abuse. You crawl back to the warm floor. By now, it is wet, dusty and you had left the door open on your way out and the mosquitoes had swarmed in to make a meal of your siblings, half sleepy and half listening to the cries and raised voices. You barely close your eyes before the alarm tears off. The same scathing ring that had torn your parents from their arms and sent them off now wakes you up reminding you that it is a crime to be poor and be at peace or even at ease with rest. The alarm is a reminder of that fact, a torment, a punishment that slowly finds itself becoming a solace.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe queue at the bathroom is long. Children who are na\\u00efve in body and mind choose the easy task to bath outside the house with brown water and detergent. But you, have to queue along with the older ones. A treatment that you are getting used to. Not because you have to queue at only this part of the morning but because you have realized that you have to queue and wait at every part of the day for anything you need. The queue is a measurement for the yardstick of patience and the poor have the distinct quality of being patient. We stand in queue to vote in election and anchor the same patience for the next election even though we know that we would always been forgotten and abandoned immediately the votes are counted and carted. We anchor the same patience after we slip thin, almost invisible ward of cash into the hands of security guard and wait for the call to inform us about our interview for a job. Whether in reading, or praying, or even waiting for the fingers behind the clouds to open up our prayer requests and answer our prayers, we anchor the same patience and so you stand at this queue, watching your neighbors go in and come out with exaggerated fervor. This is the most quiet part of your day. There is no need for discourse in shame and filth.\\n\\n\\n\\nNow comes your turn and you barely have the time to rest your towel before the grunts come in. they come the way the water from your bucket empties. First in quiet small lumps and finally the big ones. You do away with the sponge, the songs, the dreams and just wash your ears, lips, legs and your pits.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe grunts and smell of the overheated soup hits you and threatens to throw you over immediately you emerge from the bath. Your siblings, six or seven, you are beginning to lose count, hop and jump all over the tight walls picking up clothes and looking to make themselves the ghetto consideration of what the word beautiful is before they all disperse into their different halls of struggle and torment. I call it torment because this exercise is done out of the utmost unnecessary desire except the idea that this has now become the normal of the day and the only way their idea of a well spent day is thought of. It is the only way it functions in their reality. and then comes the stage where you have to search for their answers with them and stop their fighting if anyone comes up and they mostly do. Your own fighting begins at the busstop. There, you punch, kick, yell and scratch for a seat at the bus. Sometimes your hands even slip behind another person\\u2019s pocket and you cannot fight off the temptation to squeeze and pick off what you would call a Friday\\u2019s blessing from God. There has been no light for days and now you pick up your cloth from underneath the bed where you have left it for two days to maintain the gaitors that you have planted since you were a child.\\n\\n\\n\\nToday, the bus is slow. There is a tanker that has decided to rest its inefficiency in the middle of the road and now you\\u2019re the buses are moving like the legs of a constrained millipede. You are afraid to look at the fingers on your broken stop watch because you do not want to accept the reality that you might be late for your interview. Finally, this millipede moves slowly and slowly until you cannot bear it any longer. You jump out of the bus and start running through the waking streets of the city. Noises accompany and desert you and eventually you realize that you are alone in this race to salvation. You run, bend, sweat and rest until eventually you arrive at the front of the company that has managed to filter your number out of the thousand of application that they have received in the last year. You arrange your dress, smell yourself, wipe yourself with your socks and offer a little prayer before entering through the doors. Earlier in the week, your mother had offered a seed of faith in brown envelope at the pastor\\u2019s altar in hope that angels would grant you favor and drop this job and salary bonus in the center of your itchy palms. You look at the company again. You do not remember submitting you CV here and for a second you blink rapidly to make sure that you are not delusioned. You breathe in and throw your legs in front of you.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe secretary desk is empty. You do a little pace and search through the walls and perforated air before you call out. Finally, she comes. A tall woman who smell of foreign fragrance, mint and a raised eyebrow that spells arrogance. She looks at you and you can tell in that mini seconds that she knows you. Of course she knows you. She has seen you come into her office once every week and ask about a vacant position. She speaks in low tone and tells you off and does not shout or threaten to call the security except you linger and threaten to go on your knees. She wants no part of you. The smell of the heat and old musk that you carry around you is one she recognizes around the children that run around her asking for money whenever comes out of the shopping mall with big bags and wines.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u2018Yes?\\u2019 she says without opening her mouth. All she does is cock her head and raises her eyebrow while walking to her desk to grab at her sanitizers and press her hands around the security number on speeddial.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u2018My name is, she doesn\\u2019t care about your name. she probably will forgot it immediately you leave. I am here for the interview\\u2019\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u2018Which one? The one that ended an hour ago.?\\u2019\\n\\n\\n\\nYou want to tell her about the landlord, the meeting, the queue, the tanker in the middle of the road and the two hour leg walk through the busy lagos roads. But she does not give a hair and you know she doesn\\u2019t. she is already back to her desk with her eyes all over a figure that isn\\u2019t your. You have seen this scene a thousand times. You are tired of begging and asking and promising and slipping almost invisible seed of faith bribes into itchy palms. But you know she doesn\\u2019t give a hair and so you walk out. You walk out and search your pocket to see that you have walked out of the building alone. Your wallet gone. You are about to throw youself back into this secretary prescence again when you realize your folly. You had run out of the bus, forgetting your thousand naira with the conductor. Now the voices that had trailed you when you started running seem more familiar now. The conductors and passengers calling for you and your change. Oh, what story you have to tell when you get home to your family.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs you walk back home through the busy roads, now awake and roaring with fast cars, smoke and broken dreams. You do not wipe your sweat off your face instead you let them surround your eyes and flow down your hair, down your ears through your back. Your phone buzzes and at the top of the notification is a message from your girlfriend, Joy. A short text praying for you to get the job, and hoping your salary will be big enough to cover your parents and take her out to eat big chicken at the tantalizer eatery. You close your eyes and your phones and walk down the long lane as the sweat overwhelms your body.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat hurts more than the long walk is not the pain you feel but more than that, the agony when you realise that your fears are kicking in, winning and even stretching out of your body into the heart and minds of your siblings. You first see this fear in the life of your younger brother, who has started moving with the yahoo boys crowding around your home. Every word from your finite wisdom rises and falls back to dust when he realizes how deeper you sink into agony, thought and poverty. He does not want to end up like his parents. A bricklayer of a father and a mother who sells failing wares. He does not want to end up like you. A jobless graduate with a long list of dreams and unanswered prayers stretching out of his prayer mail into real life. He now thinks that the responsibility of raising his family from the drawls of poverty is his to bear now that it seems you are failing. Your sister comes back home today with a wet patch on her skirt. You recognize it but you do not want to ask her about it. Asking her is tantamount to accepting that it is real. That your sister is on the same path you led girls her age when you were twice her age. You remember don\\u2019t you, when you were younger and had the arrogance of a secondary school graduate. When you felt the world was at the tip of your tongue and fingers and dreams were as visible as puberty, yours to own, control and manipulate. How beautiful a poet karma is.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe heat comes again when you try to escape with a nap. The breeze spluttering through the window is not enough to sail a paper and now the dried sweat on your hair is stretching its stench through the whole apartment. The neighbor\\u2019s children are back from school and now the cries resume. The walls suddenly disappear and now you can hear the cries. For a moment, it seems that the universe is taunting you. Listening to sad songs to accompany your tears is not working today. Your ears have grown accustomed to company that suddenly they have become familiar neighbors, no more strangers. You look around the house, the dusty fans, the cob webs growing at the centre and sides of the room, the untidy clothes and the flies buzzing through the compound. You close your eyes, realise that there is no escape. Reality is a terror.\\n\\n\\n\\nAgain, you walk. To the crowdy rowdy market. The noise would stretch for miles and still reign over your thoughts when you are miles from it. You recognize the stalls, the familiar calls and the regulars. You walk over to your mother\\u2019s stall. Your father is already there. His head is buried over a bowl of garri and you can see the sweat dragging sand and age around his back and head. He has been laid off again. Your mother searches your eyes. There are no need for words to be exchanged. She knows. You know. Everyone knows.\", \"row_index\": 111588, \"stack_trace\": \"NoneType: None\\n\"}\n"

      "{\"timestamp\": \"2025-04-10 08:19:12,865\", \"level\": \"ERROR\", \"message\": \"Received None response from model\", \"article_text\": \"By Angela Orlando Cameli\\n\\n\\u201cWhat are all those pills you\\u2019re taking, honey?\\u201d Dad\\u2019s voice booms.\\n\\nFor a second, when I hear the H sound, I think he\\u2019s going to call me Heidi, my chosen cult name. The wine bottle shakes in my hand. I haven\\u2019t been called Heidi since I left the Children of God almost two decades ago.\\n\\n\\u201cShh,\\u201d I say, \\u201cJohn\\u2019s sleeping upstairs with the girls.\\u201d I live with my husband and two daughters who are four and six years old, in a spacious townhouse downtown, no longer crammed into the commune\\u2019s bedrooms which were flanked with bunk beds and sleeping bags.\\n\\nDad and I are in my kitchen in Chicago, cleaning up after a family party. In his sixties, he\\u2019s wider and grayer. In my thirties, so am I. Dad lives in Spain with my mom and two younger sisters, but he visits Chicago often these days to help care for his ill and aging parents. Our relationship has always been complicated. \\u201cHeidi\\u201d never could have imagined this normal life for herself. She should\\u2019ve died a martyr for her faith years ago, like the prophet predicted.\\n\\nThe cult began in the late 1960s and members lived communally worldwide. No one held secular jobs or went to school because the second coming of Christ was imminent. They supported themselves by begging and selling cult-produced media. To show God\\u2019s love, some sanctioned practices included prostitution for Jesus and sexual interactions with everyone regardless of age, relation, or marital status.\\n\\nThousands of publications printed the teachings of the Children of God\\u2019s prophet, David Berg. Like The Story Of Davidito, a 762-page manual that educated cult members on how to have the most productive sexual time with children, featuring Berg\\u2019s son Davidito watching orgies, engaging in threesomes, and receiving fellatio starting when he was less than two years old.\\n\\nThe Children of God liked to separate families to maximize control. From the ages of seven to sixteen, my twin brother Michael and I lived in communes all over Europe and the Soviet Union, often with our sisters, but without our parents. At sixteen, Michael decided to renounce the cult, and we lived in Chicago as a family, where the four of us attended school for the first time. After our eighteenth birthdays, our parents returned to the communes in Spain with our sisters. I stayed in Chicago with Michael.\\n\\nWhen Dad is in Spain, we only hear from him on our birthdays and Christmas. In Chicago, he\\u2019s attentive and communicates constantly. Dad is a wonderful cook and will spend hours making elaborate meals for my family. He\\u2019s also a fun grandpa who never tires of playing hide and seek or doing art projects. However, Dad\\u2019s rambling, Bible-thumping, and the many unresolved issues we avoid, leave me drained and reaching for the bottle.\\n\\nDad points to the pile of pills sitting on the kitchen island. In the Children of God, medication and doctors\\u2019 visits were prohibited. Heidi, the programmed cultie who yearned to live with her biological family instead of abusive cult members, appears. She wants to please him by keeping the conversation light. But I\\u2019m not her anymore. I\\u2019ve fought hard to give myself a voice.\\n\\n\\u201cThey are for the nightmares.\\u201d My throat hoarse, I take another gulp. Dad\\u2019s bloodshot eyes are glued on mine. \\u201cSince becoming a mom, it\\u2019s my daughters in my dreams, not a younger version of me. For years, I barely slept at night. John would have to shake me awake and tell me I was dreaming. Then, I\\u2019d run to the girls\\u2019 room to make sure that they were okay.\\u201d\\n\\nMy ears get hot. There\\u2019s so much unacknowledged pain and trauma simmering underneath the surface. As a parent, there are so many things I cannot comprehend. Why did my parents remain in the Children of God after adults began to sexually assault children? One of my earliest cult memories is of Uncle Paul\\u2019s enormous sweaty palm clasped over my six-year-old fist as he dragged me to his bedroom to show me God\\u2019s Love. Consent was never possible; we were not allowed to say no.\\n\\nWhy did they deny us access to education and medical attention? I spent plenty of weeks sequestered in quarantine rooms with other sick people, in communes from Argentina to Poland to Siberia, instead of going to the doctor. We had to trust God to cure us, even if that meant winding up dead. Until I was sixteen, my years were spent cooking, cleaning, fundraising, and watching kids barely younger than me, instead of going to school.\\n\\nWhy did they let the leadership separate our family? Some of the adults we lived with were nice, others weren\\u2019t. I can still feel some of the beatings I received for opening my eyes and talking during prayer, instead of quoting Bible verses. My exhausting days entailed begging in extreme heat and frigid temperatures to support the cult, instead of being allowed to listen to music, read secular books, or watch television.\\n\\nWhy did they leave Michael and me behind, unconcerned with whether we could make it on our own? The second they left us, the rampant drug and alcohol abuse began that nearly destroyed us both. I attempted suicide and put myself in dangerous situations. For example, dancing nude in sleazy strip clubs, until I could obtain a fake ID to strip at classier establishments, in order to put myself through college. Michael broke the law, had trouble keeping jobs, and destroyed his relationship with Dad\\u2019s family.\\n\\nDad chugs more wine, his pupils dilate. Not wanting to get emotional in front of him, I swallow tears and clench my fists. \\u201cI\\u2019ve worked really hard to reduce my meds. This is a sleeping pill and this PTSD treatment stops me from dreaming. The doctor said it\\u2019s the best someone with my history can hope for. He thinks it\\u2019s remarkable how far I\\u2019ve come.\\u201d\\n\\nI hold my head up high. Dad\\u2019s body jerks out of its slump. I refill both glasses, impatient for the fuzzy relief I know the wine will bring. He creases his brow and throws his shoulders back.\\n\\n\\u201cWhat PTSD?\\u201d Bluish veins pop in his neck. The decibels of his voice skyrocket. In the trash bin, I stack the empty wine bottle on top of all the others. His chapped lips are moving, but it\\u2019s the prophet\\u2019s words that echo in my ear as Dad regurgitates all the lies cult members were programmed to tell outsiders. Incest wasn\\u2019t condoned. We weren\\u2019t forced to have sexual interactions. Prostitution for Jesus was misconstrued. Public beatings and exorcisms never happened. We didn\\u2019t live in extreme poverty.\\n\\nMy heart hurts. His denial of the abuse feels worse than having had to go through it. It\\u2019s like ripping scabs off mending wounds. For the past to no longer have a hold on me, I must confront Dad\\u2019s pattern of lying.\\n\\nThrough a clenched jaw, Dad drains his glass. \\u201cI sacrificed my entire life to serve Jesus. I trusted God and my comrades to look out for my family. You had a wonderful childhood. You saw the world and served God! It\\u2019s other kids who were deprived.\\u201d\\n\\nDad\\u2019s denial keeps the trauma alive because we can\\u2019t confront and deal with it. A burning rage takes over as I imagine smashing these wine bottles over his nose. I open another one and swirl the peachy undertows in my glass. \\u201cYup! Begging, eating rotten food, being beaten, molested and being a child laborer was wonderful!\\u201d\\n\\nIn 2005, the prophet\\u2019s son Davidito, who was born Ricky Rodriguez, killed one of his abusers and then killed himself. I was twenty-six years old, going to graduate school, and living with John at the time. Davidito\\u2019s suicide video on 20/20 filled the TV screen as he said, \\u201cI have this need for revenge. This need for justice. I cannot go on like this\\u2026. If there\\u2019s a next life, I can look back and see that I did what I could\\u2026.\\u201d How can you do that to kids and sleep at night? Thousands of us were fucked over, literally. Where was our apology?\\u201d\\n\\nI ran to the bathroom and threw up violently. That night I drank two bottles of wine and sobbed. My heart was broken. The following morning, I promised myself that I would use my voice. For Davidito. For me. For all of us.\\n\\nMom and Dad had just been in town the week before I saw Davidito\\u2019s death on TV. They knew, but never breathed a word. Michael and I were livid that they didn\\u2019t tell us about our friend\\u2019s death. When we confronted them, they denied Davidito\\u2019s well-documented abuse. We didn\\u2019t speak to our parents for a year.\\n\\nThat year, like many of the ones that preceded it, I binged on cocaine and couldn\\u2019t quit drinking or smoking, no matter how hard I tried. Holding onto the rage desecrated me. My bitterness didn\\u2019t impact my parents in the least; they likely didn\\u2019t even notice that I stopped answering phone calls and returning emails. Like drinking poison, it hurt only me.\\n\\nMy parents never asked for forgiveness, and although they might not have deserved it, I forgave anyway, because that\\u2019s what I needed in order to move on. Eventually, with the support of my husband, my brother and sisters, and with my hard-won education, I was able to ditch cocaine and cigarettes for good. Numbness had always been my armor, but it kept me stuck instead of moving forward. I had to learn healthier ways to soothe my pain besides abusing drugs and alcohol, even though as a child I was never taught the tools to cope with trauma.\\n\\nThe vibrant moon glimmers through my open balcony doors. Growing up, windows and doors stayed closed and covered to hide the mangy, overcrowded living conditions. Outside, a flashlight zooms around the midnight air; it\\u2019s the security guard checking the perimeter of our gated community. Unlike the high compound walls of my youth that kept me locked in fear with my predators, this fencing has gaps and transparency. There aren\\u2019t hordes of parked caravans and motorhomes to hide in, no ravenous and bruised children to conceal.\\n\\nDad pounds on the counter, drunk and angry. \\u201cWhy do you listen to those liars? It\\u2019s all bullshit! No kids were mistreated!\\u201d\\n\\nThe cult disbanded a few years back when the leaders vanished with decades of members\\u2019 monthly tithe. Leadership\\u2019s families retired, set for life while people like my parents continue to live in squalor, penniless, trying to figure out what comes next. I wonder, even now, why my dad continues to defend them. It may be the shame, or he can\\u2019t be deprogrammed.\\n\\n\\u201cYou have a master\\u2019s degree from the University of Chicago!\\u201d Dad says, pointing his gnarled finger in my face. \\u201cNone of your cousins or friends who went to school their entire lives have accomplished that!\\u201d\\n\\nI wring my hands together. \\u201cThat\\u2019s because I busted my ass stripping while going to school full-time and found friends to give me the love and support you never could.\\u201d\\n\\nArguing with him makes me feel helpless again, like Heidi, who wasn\\u2019t allowed to speak the truth. But I\\u2019m not Heidi anymore. I am Angela. Educated. Resilient. Honest.\\n\\nThis cannot end like the rest of our arguments, him spewing his version of events and me letting him live with his delusions. The silence of his denial weighs on my chest and suffocates me. After eighteen years in the cult and eighteen years out of it, I\\u2019m at the point in my life where I must move forward. My daughters deserve a strong mother who\\u2019s not afraid to use her voice or challenge a man.\\n\\n\\u201cHow can you deny that kids were victimized, that I was molested? How do you explain The Story Of Davidito that taught culties how to abuse children? If you can\\u2019t be honest, I\\u2019ll never speak to you again. You will be out of my life forever. You have always chosen them over me, over everything. For once Dad, choose me!\\u201d\\n\\nSwallowing the tears becomes impossible. And so, I sob. As Heidi, I was never allowed to express emotions. Now that I own my feelings, I no longer need to run, numb, or dissociate.\\n\\nDad puts his arms up in mockery protest. \\u201cI guess not everything about the way you were raised was perfect. Everybody makes mistakes\\u2026\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cAt least Mom\\u2019s made amends.\\u201d\\n\\nMom has apologized for not protecting us when we were kids. She lost her mother to breast cancer months before she decided to leave Michael and me. The guilt of disappearing for 20 years to join a cult must have been overwhelming for her. I understand why she wanted to move back to Spain to be near her father for his last remaining years. She told me that splitting up our family is her biggest regret. She\\u2019s a wonderful grandmother and mother to our sisters. That is enough for me. Trauma victims haven\\u2019t had much, so we expect little.\\n\\nDad rubs the nape of his neck, \\u201cI thought The Story Of Davidito was just something that the prophet and leadership were experimenting with.\\u201d His breathing escalates as he clasps his hands over his face. \\u201cI never touched a child and never in a million years thought it would be practiced on you.\\u201d\\n\\nSeeing the despair in his eyes summons up compliant Heidi. She tries to claw her way back into my skin, pry my lips shut, humble my stance, and make me the good girl again. I\\u2019m in awe of this younger version, of all she\\u2019ll put herself through, of all she\\u2019ll endure.\\n\\n\\u201cThank you,\\u201d I say, slouched and rubbing my eyes. \\u201cOne last thing. Did you feel any remorse for abandoning Michael and me?\\u201d\\n\\nDad smacks his palm against his forehead and steps back, \\u201cYou were eighteen! Adults! Same age as I was when I left home!\\u201d\\n\\nMy great-grandfather deserted his family for months on end to chase women. My grandpa kicked Dad out of the house when he was that age because he was a hippie who refused to cut his hair. Dad abandoned Michael and me because we left the cult. By the age of 18, Michael, Dad, and I were unfathered and unmothered.\\n\\nUnlike many kids these days, who live with their parents, with college and health insurance, Dad was thrown into the world just like Michael and me, with no safety net. Tripping on acid, he met the cult\\u2019s hippies and boarded a plane to Italy with nothing but a toothbrush and his passport, looking for purpose and adventure. I planted roots in Chicago, searching for love and acceptance. After six years of stripping, where I was beaten, drugged, and nearly raped, I secured a career as a school social worker.\\n\\n\\u201cI\\u2019m exhausted,\\u201d I say. \\u201cGood night.\\u201d\\n\\nIn bed, waiting for my pills to kick in, I scroll through photos on my phone. One sticks out: Dad animatedly playing the guitar while my daughters are jumping and laughing. I see him as the scared teenager, forced to leave his dysfunctional home. His growth is stunted. He hasn\\u2019t mentally progressed past that point.\\n\\nI\\u2019ve advanced, though. I\\u2019ve reclaimed my name. My body. Even though the nightmares persist, they are infrequent. John still shakes me awake and says, \\u201cYou\\u2019re safe baby. You\\u2019re safe.\\u201d Now, I finally believe him and roll back to sleep.\\n\\nThe following morning, I\\u2019m hungover. My stomach churns while my head pounds. However, baring my soul has brought a subtle peace. I breathe a little easier, my rapid heartbeat slows. Dad doesn\\u2019t need to tell me he hasn\\u2019t slept. His eyes are bloodshot and his shoulders slump. \\u201cI just want you to know that I love you, all my children, with all my heart. I never meant for any of you to get hurt. I really believed I was fulfilling the highest calling in my life by serving Jesus.\\u201d\\n\\nFor the first time, I don\\u2019t pull away from his grippy hug. Even though it\\u2019s hard to accept that love is often packaged with hurt and abandonment, I realize that forgiveness is not about him. It\\u2019s what I need to move on. My forgiveness isn\\u2019t complete, it may never be, but it\\u2019s a beginning. My compulsion to communicate honestly with him is for my sake, to make me whole.\\n\\nDad walks out of my garage with his guitar strapped to his back. By making him my witness, I see the pain in him. I see his shame and try not to let it break my heart. That\\u2019s his cross to bear. I\\u2019ve broken my own heart more than anyone ever could. With him sharing my burden, the weight seems lighter. Dad will still live in his version of the truth. I can\\u2019t change that. But I\\u2019ve been heard, and he loves me just the same.\\n\\nFirst published by: www.twohawksquarterly.com\", \"row_index\": 133957, \"stack_trace\": \"NoneType: None\\n\"}\n"

While many men wisely choose to book ahead and line up many Thai women using online dating, other guys land and then start wondering what to do next.\\n\\nIs that bewildered guy now you?\\n\\nHow do you go about quickly find Thai women in Thailand as a newly landed tourist?\\n\\nMeeting Thai girls when traveling in Thailand is not easy. Opportunities dramatically increase when a traveler uses proven strategies. Our research shows using business cards, asking direct questions, and giving Thai women compliments will provide you with a 260% uplift in meeting opportunities.\\n\\nWe have got you covered though.\\n\\nAll of these techniques will work for new tourists. You\\u2019ll be entering Thailand through a major airport and a capital city.\\n\\nLarge cities are densely populated, with willing Thai women, many of whom will be ready companions.\\n\\nPrepare a Business Card\\n\\nThis technique is for shy guys and players. You are better to prepare ahead of time, but local assistance is available too, so don\\u2019t fret.\\n\\nWhat\\u2019s Needed, First?\\n\\nYour name \\u2014 either first name only or full name is ok, depending on your privacy concerns). Decide on an occupation to list. \\u2018IT Consultant\\u2019, \\u2018Business Strategist\\u2019, \\u2018Financial Services Manager\\u2019 is vague enough to use. If you have a Thai phone number list, we recommend using a Line ID though.\\n\\nThe Line application is used predominately throughout Thailand.\\n\\nIt is available free through any App Store as well as a desktop application.\\n\\nOnce installed, configure you own Line ID\\n\\nList this Line ID on your business card\\n\\n4. Go to your local printer before you leave your country and get 100 printed or whatever their minimum happens to be.\\n\\n5. No cards when you land? A quick visit to Fortune Town at Pharam 9 is the answer. You\\u2019ll have business cards in 30 minutes.\\n\\nWhat is \\u2018Business Card Strategy\\u2019?\\n\\nEach example style has its own merits for privacy and your fun value. Mix and match.\\n\\nThai women are typically shy and reserved when meeting strangers, especially foreigners.\\n\\nYou need to break the ice with these girls and allow them time to settle in and be comfortable.\\n\\nThe easy option is a business card with your contact details.\\n\\nYou will use your freshly printed business card in a variety of situations.\\n\\nThe BTS and MRT Transport Systems\\n\\nBangkok has the worst traffic imaginable.\\n\\nThe easiest and fastest way to commute around the city is to use the convenient rail systems.\\n\\nThe rail systems are fabulous for the first time visitor like you, but Thai girls are here in abundance.\\n\\nThai people use public transport extensively. Thai women use these rapid transit trains to travel to their job, try out new eating spots during their lunch break, and then there\\u2019s party time after work.\\n\\nThe BTS and MRT lines are perfect to meet Thai girls.\\n\\nYour benefit is seeing the girls in their sexy work uniforms.\\n\\nJust give them the card though. Don\\u2019t bother trying to talk to the girl. The transport trains are busy, over-crowded and the women may not be alone.\\n\\nYou don\\u2019t want to embarrass her.\\n\\nShe\\u2019ll contact you on Line if she\\u2019s interested to know you more.\\n\\nThis plan is a mass handout strategy. Ride the BTS/MRT, hand out your cards to many and a few girls will contact you. You\\u2019re on your way to chatting and dating.\\n\\nWhen You\\u2019re Out Eating\\n\\nWhen the guy is eating out, you will see Thai men give their cards to Thai girls.\\n\\nThe passing of Info cards is a standard system used across Thailand. You need to do the same. The giving of cards is already a proven technique, and Thai women expect the receive business cards.\\n\\nAlways do what the locals do. Acceptance is high, and resistance is low. THE PASSING OF CARDS IS THE SECRET SAUCE\\n\\nGive your cards out at a restaurant, when girls are waiting around for their street food or when you see a group of Thai girls eating together after they\\u2019ve finished work.\\n\\nWe\\u2019ve used this approach ourselves to great success.\\n\\nCoffee Shops\\n\\nThai women love coffee shops. Visit and pass out your cards.\\n\\nCoffee shops have a massive attraction to groups of bored Thai women.\\n\\nThe girls don\\u2019t go for the coffee which most finds bitter and keeps them buzzed up for too long. The women love the selfies they can snap with the tasty treats and bubble tea.\\n\\nAs we mentioned before, just give them one of your cards and return to your table. The woman will hook you up on Line either then and there or later when she\\u2019s more comfortable at home.\\n\\nSpend several hours browsing the town, have a few coffees, see the sights and pass out the business cards.\\n\\nYou\\u2019ll be getting incoming friend requests before you return to your hotel.\\n\\nThe Lost Puppy Strategy\\n\\nThai women love cute things. Be her lost puppy. Act cute and unassuming.\\n\\nThis approach works wonders in shopping malls and grocery shops.\\n\\nYou will be using your lack of knowledge to trigger your chosen girl to help you.\\n\\nThai women are mothering by nature. Thai tradition teaches them always to be helpful. Use this to your advantage.\\n\\nArm yourself with the Google Translate app installed on your smartphone, in case you do run into some translation problems. You are in a different country, after all.\\n\\nGood Introduction question include:-\\n\\n\\u2018Do you know where the toilets are?\\u2019\\n\\n\\u2018Hello, where is a good coffee shop?\\u2019\\n\\n\\u2018Where do I find the coffee?\\u2019\\n\\n\\u2018Can I buy good Thai food here?\\u2019\\n\\nThe best idea is to pre-load these questions into Google Translate and \\u2018Star\\u2019 them, so they\\u2019re readily available when you need to whip the app out and present the problem to the girl.\\n\\nThe Good Mannered Man\\n\\nWhat did your mother always tell you as a boy?\\n\\n\\u201cBe polite and well-mannered, my boy\\u201d.\\n\\nWith Thais being a gentle natured, happy, and polite people; being well behaved and respectful goes a long way in Thailand. Especially for grabbing the attention of lonely Thai girls.\\n\\nAs a matter of course, always say \\u2018Hello\\u2019 to staff and give your full attention to them as if they are someone special (which they are). Look directly at the woman\\u2019s eyes and give a beaming smile as you do it.\\n\\nEvery Thai girl craves for the attention of a respectful good-mannered foreigner man. All of them!\\n\\nYou will be surprised how many waitresses, young cleaners, and hotel staff will come knocking on your door during your stay at their hotel.\\n\\nThese female staffs know you\\u2019re on a short stay holiday. The girls have nothing to lose with a gentle knock on your door. And everything to gain which includes you getting some quality sex time with the opportunity of a happy Thai travel companion.\\n\\nPro Tip:- Pay the same \\u2018attention and respect\\u2019 practises to older Thai ladies too. Treat them with exceptional politeness and get to chatting with them whenever you see them. Older women will love the attention and English practise and start to like you. Older Thai women have an expansive network of female friends and relatives. After a few days, casually ask the older lady \\u201cdo you have a good girlfriend for me?\\u201d Thailand Fact:- Personal recommendation carries tremendous positive weight here. When you\\u2019re suggested to a young Thai girl by an older woman, the younger girl knows she must comply. There\\u2019ll be no games played on you by the girl. She has already been mentored and understands your expectations. Take the girl out to dinner, and both enjoy yourselves. Indulge in a nightcap or three. Then it\\u2019s back to your hotel room for the remainder of the night\\u2019s festivities.\\n\\nThe Sole Farang Syndrome\\n\\nBeing the only one of your kind has its advantages.\\n\\nMany parts of Thailand are never visited by foreign holiday-makers; including parts of every major city.\\n\\nForeign holiday-makers avoid many parts of Thailand; including parts of every major city.\\n\\nBeing a \\u2018foreign newcomer\\u2019 means you become an object of great interest to Thai girls. Even in parts of Bangkok, there are Thai ladies who rarely if ever see a foreigner. To your advantage, most of those girls have never slept with one either.\\n\\nWhere should you start?\\n\\nChoose any BTS or MRT rail line and journey six or more stops away from Sukhumvit. Look on Google Maps for the main Soi (this is Thai for the word \\u2018road or street\\u2019) near that station and take a taxi a mile or two down that Soi.\\n\\nYou\\u2019ve arrived at the start of an area with little to no foreigners.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s time to go shopping. All you\\u2019re doing is browsing the shops for Thai girls, but you can pretend to shop, at least.\\n\\nStop in and browse around. If you spot an attractive girl, stroll up and compliment her. Tell the girl \\u201cSawadee krap, you very beautiful\\u201d. Drop your business card and walk out. The woman you just complimented will be thinking about you all day. She will never have had that attention from a foreigner before. Rinse and repeat to more stores Line requests will inundate you.\\n\\nIt isn\\u2019t difficult to see why this works so well.\\n\\nYou are the same as a bar of Belgian chocolate in Thailand.\\n\\nRare and never tasted before. These girls want to unwrap their sweet.\\n\\nA Wingman\\n\\nIt\\u2019s common for tourists to travel with a friend.\\n\\nHaving a friend is another winning formula, and you get even better opportunities with scoring Thai women.\\n\\nTry this:-\\n\\nGo out together with your mate. You can decide on a bar/club or Shopping Mall\\n\\nthe location isn\\u2019t as important as the technique.\\n\\n2. Now for the Rule\\n\\nThe one that finds a girl invites her for a night-out\\n\\nAsk that girl to bring a friend to meet with your friend\\n\\nWhy does this tactic work?\\n\\nYour invited Thai girl isn\\u2019t scared to come because she won\\u2019t be alone\\n\\nDating in a small group is more fun\\n\\nBoth you and your mate are in for a treat. Thai women are a bundle of happiness together\\n\\nThe invited girls know exactly how the evening is going to end\\n\\nWe\\u2019ve used this strategy many times and ended up traveling around Thailand several times, with our two girl combo.\\n\\nYour potential outcomes with girls in Thailand are incredible. They love to fuck, and they love to travel. Combine the two with your travel buddy.\\n\\nPro Tip:- Agree with all your travel buddies to never hit on any Thai girl any of you have contacted. We\\u2019ve seen many good friends have tragic falling outs together, all over a girl their friend was sweet on. You must all make a cardinal rule and agree. Nobody else hits on another guy\\u2019s contact. There are 23 million Thai women within the dating age range in Thailand. Don\\u2019t fuck over a long term friendship when it is easy to find another girl or just pay a Freelancer for a release.\\n\\nAsk And Ye Shall Receive\\n\\nAsking all Thai girls whether they have a boyfriend is as direct as it comes.\\n\\nMost men aren\\u2019t brave enough. You will be after several attempts.\\n\\nRemember, no-one else knows you in Thailand. There is no reputation tarnish.\\n\\nWhat happens in Thailand stays in Thailand.\\n\\nAsk if the girl has a boyfriend. If she says she does, reply that her boyfriend is a lucky man because she is so pretty.\\n\\nBUT \\u2026\\n\\nYou continue your brief interlude with the girl by asking \\u201cShe have a sister or a friend \\u2018same like you\\u2019. I look for a good girl\\u201d.\\n\\nIf the woman doesn\\u2019t have a boyfriend, ask for her Line ID and give her your business card. Depending on your schedule and location, have a coffee or chocolate drink together.\\n\\nThat will be your first date too.\\n\\nClosing\\n\\nYour opportunities dramatically increase when you follow proven strategies.\\n\\nThese five techniques have been used multiple times across multiple holidays in Thailand.\\n\\nThese approaches are easy to follow and will work for your equally well.\\n\\nEquip yourself with business cards in your wallet and watch the magic happen.\\n\\nEnjoy your travels with many pretty Thai girls across Thailand.\\n\\nFAQ\\n\\nWhat are good strategies for picking up Thai girls as a tourist?\\n\\nBusiness cards are essential in many situations\\n\\nuse cards on public transport systems\\n\\nwhile you are out eating\\n\\nat any local coffee shop\\n\\nThe \\u2018Lost Puppy\\u2019 strategy is awesome\\n\\nThe \\u2018Good Mannered\\u2019 tourist works 100% of the time\\n\\nPlay the \\u2018Sole Farang Syndrome\\u2019 and Thai women will always contact you back\\n\\nA wingman and a double Thai girl combo\\n\\nWhy is it difficult for Thailand tourist to find good Thai girls?\\n\\nMany Thai girls are simply shy of foreigners\\n\\nYou are looking in the wrong places\\n\\nShe is busy and your timing is off\\n\\nYou are coming across too strong and demanding\\n\\nWhere are the best places to meet good Thai girls?\", \"row_index\": 144235, \"stack_trace\": \"NoneType: None\\n\"}\n"

      "{\"timestamp\": \"2025-04-10 12:30:12,916\", \"level\": \"ERROR\", \"message\": \"Received None response from model\", \"article_text\": \"I became aware of the human trafficking for the sex exploitation issue in Italy for the first time in 2015 when I moved to Bologna.\\n\\nI rented an apartment close to Porta San Vitale with a balcony that looked over an alley where three Nigerian women stayed to meet their clients every night. On the other side of the main road, two Romanian women waited for clients to stop by with their car.\\n\\nThey were from 19 up to 40 years old. These women are a constant nightly presence on the ring road that surrounds the historic center of Bologna. They are like shadows that appear at dusk and disappear at dawn.\\n\\nI owe their acquaintance to my dog\\u2019s friendliness. She was a rescued dog. I had adopted her from an animal shelter and found out immediately after she was hopelessly sick. Yet, she outlived what the veterinarians initially predicted, and for sure, it was thanks to her great love of life. And for the same reason, none could resist her joyful, playful, puppy-like approach despite being 4 years old.\\n\\nI believe that\\u2019s what gained me the trust of the Nigerian and Romanian women. Every time we meet them in our daily evening walk, she stopped to entertain them with her whimsical jumps and pirouettes. Even if she was just a dog, I honestly think she made them feel special, like only an innocent soul can do. She saw the good in their heart.\\n\\nYet, one day, the rumors about us had spread within this underground community so much that someone got suspicious. One night, while I was talking as usual with the younger among them, a skinny and pale 19-year-old Romanian, I noticed her cellphone was in a call. Someone on the other end, probably her pimp, was listening to our conversation.\\n\\nIn that year, I spent much time researching and documenting myself on human trafficking for the sexual exploitation of Nigerian and Romanian women and girls in Italy. I read the few books I found on the issue, written by journalists on behalf of survivors, and some outdated surveys on the phenomenon. I even contacted Isoke Aikpitanyi, a survivor who had broken free from her traffickers and then founded the anti-trafficking association Women of Benin City. I also approached the local association who had just won the open call of the city for fundings.\\n\\nSo, I discovered two different realities of human trafficking fed by the poverty of the countries of origin, low education, and the demand for sex slaves in Europe. The criminal organizations that deceptively recruit them and traffick them throughout Europe are separate and deploy distinctive strategies to coerce them into prostitution. Moreover, they are priced differently, perhaps for a racist factor. Darker skin is valued less than a whiter one.\\n\\nThe East-European sex trafficking model\\n\\nRomanian and East-European victims usually are brought to Italy by a partner and sold or included in a prostitution ring controlled by the Albanian mafia. Or their trafficking ordeal starts here like occurred to a 20-year-old Romanian woman in the summer of 2019 in Tuscania (VT). She was deceived by a partner, moved to the UK and then to Romania, coerce to prostitute themselves, and then sold to a criminal group.\\n\\nA recent Deutsche Welle\\u2019s documentary reveals how the recruitment of these modern slaves for the European sex market also passes through job advertisements on social media platforms like Facebook. The traffickers lure women and girls coming from below-the-poverty-threshold households from East-European countries, especially Romania, with a promise of escaping poverty in Western Europe. The most popular destination is Germany, where sex work and brothels are legal.\\n\\nMost of these women and girls belong to minorities \\u2014 like Roma \\u2014 that still suffer from discrimination in their home countries. They usually live in small communities at the edge of society in the countryside, surviving without any statal aid. They are citizens of the European Union, but they don\\u2019t enjoy the same rights in our countries and are left without legal protection.\\n\\nWhen I started informing myself on sex trafficking, the first thing I learned was that the victims at higher risk are behind closed doors, like in a strip club or in a brothel. Indeed, they have fewer opportunities to escape to their captors, considered their every move is monitored. Moreover, it\\u2019s far more difficult for anti-trafficking organizations and law enforcement to reach them for help. Whereas when they are outdoor, a distraction from their pimp may turn their fortune.\\n\\nEstimates suggest that up to 90 percent of women involved in the German sex industry have been forced into the sex trade. Legalizing prostitution as a service provider employment has made it more difficult to prove their status as human trafficking victims.\\n\\nAnyway, I want to point out that this is not only a German issue.\\n\\nAccording to a 2012 paper in the journal World Development: \\u201cCountries with legalized prostitution have a statistically significantly larger reported incidence of human trafficking inflows.\\u201d\\n\\nYet, in countries like Italy, where since 1958 the Merlin law shut down the brothels, the sex market demand remains one of the highest. Italy is a standard stop in the sex trafficking route.\\n\\nOur catholic prudishness doesn\\u2019t curb the growing demand for sex slaves in my country, and the average clients who rape them are not what you would expect.\\n\\nThe Nigerian sex trafficking model in Italy\\n\\nAs I mentioned before, when I moved to the apartment near Porta San Vitale, I had a balcony facing the meeting spot of three Nigerian women with their clients. Many of them were young guys of my age who paid to have sex with them under filthy arcs that people used as outdoor toilets.\\n\\nI remember that the younger one, a 20-year-old woman, was still paying a debt to her maman. The other two kept working on the streets after paying off their debt because they had no work permit.\\n\\nIn 2002, the Bossi-Fini law introduced the clandestine offense for migrants without a visa, followed by the Viminal plan \\u2018Vie libere\\u2019. It entailed two times month charter flights for deporting the Nigerian women sexually exploited on the Italian streets.\\n\\nSince then, the climate of intolerance fed by the far-right populist propaganda and the mismanagement of the migrant emergency by the European Union has grown even more year after year. Humanitarian ONGs and activists have been put under trial, and despite never being charged, were indicted by the public opinion.\\n\\nActivists, like Isoke Aikpitanyi, who in 2017 was accused of aiding and abetting illegal immigration for helping victims and survivors of human trafficking. She was then forced to shut down the safe houses she opened with the anti-trafficking association she founded.\\n\\nOr as it happened to Domenico \\u2018Mimmo\\u2019 Lucano, the Riace\\u2019s ex-mayor. He implemented a successful migrant-hosting and integration policy system; that is taken as a role model of good management practices of immigration internationally. Then, in October 2017, he got a notification as a suspected person by the Locri prosecutor\\u2019s office. Italy\\u2019s highest court, \\u2018La Corte di Cassazione\\u2019 annulled many of the charges he was accused of, but on the 16th October 2018, he was banished from Riace.\\n\\nThen, in 2018, the Salvini decree was issued, making it even more arduous for survivors of trafficking to get protection and renew their immigration status.\\n\\nThese are just some examples of the dismantling activities of the reception system the Italian Government has been carrying out in the last decade for the sake of populist consent. The idea is to ignore the migrant emergency defunding all the non-profit organizations, the shelters, and safe houses that were actually helping in its management.\\n\\nThese factors have worsened the conditions of Nigerian sex trafficking victims in Italy. Fewer safe houses, shelters, and gratuitous services mean fewer opportunities for them to seek help and escape the sex trade. Moreover, the fear of deportation prevents these women from speaking with the police or confiding with anti-trafficking associations. They are also scared of retaliation against their families at home for breaking the oath of loyalty done during a voodoo ritual they undergo before they depart for Europe. They swear to be loyal to the madam or maman who has bought them.\\n\\nMost of these girls come from Benin City, the capital, and the Edo State. They are recruited by middlemen commonly known as italianos who promise them a legal job in Europe. They are moved through the well-known Central Mediterranean Route (CMR) with a stop that can last some months in Lybia. Here girls and women are kept captive for months in brothels and raped multiple times as an initiation ritual to prostitution. Yet, the more lucky ones don\\u2019t undergo similar tortures until they\\u2019ve got to Europe, and more precisely, to the country where the madam or maman who paid for them wait for their arrival. Only at that moment, they find out that the journey comes at the cost of a steep debt they\\u2019ll have to repay their maman, which grows with the daily expenses for accommodation, food, and bills. If they refuse to go on the streets, they\\u2019re beaten and eventually repeatedly raped by Black Boys until they surrender.\\n\\nThe mamans are themselves former victims who had undergone the same demeaning process of violence daily. After repaying their debt, many buy other girls for not coming back on the streets. Others want just to escape poverty and elevate their social status in their home countries. All the money they gain from the sex exploitation is directed back to Nigeria, where they buy houses and the respect they hadn\\u2019t received before. Let be clear, not all sex trafficking victims become maman, and not every madam was forced into prostitution.\\n\\nAccording to Carla Quinto, a lawyer working with the anti-trafficking organization Be Free, 90% of them are survivors themselves. The law usually pursues them, while the men who are the key players in Libya, Europe, and Nigeria remain beyond reach because of a lack of international cooperation and major economic interests at play. The Nigerian and the Italian mafia are all into this trade of human beings.\\n\\nOur men are the demand: they can also be the answer\\n\\nAnyway, the end consumers that make it so lucrative are the men we would never suspect of. They are our friends, cousins, uncles, fathers, brothers, etc. They are not monsters and not always the bad guys. Many of them are ignorant of the conditions of slavery the women they\\u2019re paying of are kept in.\\n\\nWhile others take off their mask as supportive husbands or fianc\\u00e9s and show their true face of misogynists, that is not so well-accepted in society anymore. So, they discharge all their frustration and anger against these women who are the most vulnerable and have no protection. There is no risk for these rapists to be caught because trafficked women don\\u2019t trust law enforcement, and with good reason.\\n\\nIn the few cases, they are brave enough to report the violence, the police are quick in dismissing the allegations. In the end, the law enforcement and eventual doctors who treat them assume these women have chosen this life. Their professional judgment is biased by the moral principle that a good woman would prefer to starve rather than sell her body. So the stigma of prostitution keeps them even more trapped.\\n\\nThe truth is that they are disposable products for the modern European men who want all: a wife or fianc\\u00e9e to respect and an exotic creature to dominate for some hour at night.\\n\\nThe Nordic Model: Chase the clients\\n\\nIf there wasn\\u2019t a demand, there would be no offer. That\\u2019s the law of the market.\\n\\nFor this reason, many social operators and observers in the field suggest adopting the Swedish model (or Nordic model) could represent a turning point in the fight against sex trafficking.\\n\\nThis law on prostitution criminalizes the buyer of sexual services and not the seller.\\n\\nIt proved to be the most effective deterrent against human trafficking inflows.\\n\\nThis approach has now been adopted in Sweden, Norway, Iceland, Northern Ireland, Canada, France, Ireland, and Israel.\\n\\nTake-home message\\n\\nWhen I was a teenager, and I started noticing the women on the roads, with high heels and mini skirts, half-naked even in winter, I asked my parents who were they doing? They explained to me they were \\u2018lucciole\\u2019 (fireflies). That\\u2019s a sweetened way of calling them in Italy.\\n\\nThere was no judgment on their part towards these women, but they were wrong in confusing them with prostitutes. Human trafficking victims are robbed of their agency, and they don\\u2019t voluntarily choose to be sold. They are raped every day multiple times a day and silenced by a hypocritical society in exchange for money that goes directly to pimps, mamans, and the mafias.\\n\\nIf we want to stop human trafficking for sexual exploitation in our civilized countries, we have to look at home. We have to inform people about this issue. We have to change the ways we and the others around us think and refer to these women. We have to learn to openly ask our male friends, relatives, and partners if they had ever had such sexual encounters.\\n\\nThe idea of fireflies is quite romantic: nightly creatures who illuminate our roads. Yet, there is nothing romantic in the daily torture these women and girls are subject to. But maybe this image can help us in other ways: because like fireflies, they have a light still pulsing inside them, despite all the horror, and we shall focus on that and never let it be extinguished.\", \"row_index\": 182287, \"stack_trace\": \"NoneType: None\\n\"}\n"

      "Text  : Its been a few days since I came upon a project to build a desktop application. I have worked on web and mobile applications in the past using React and React-Native but this was something new. Long ago, I heard about a framework that allows us to create multi-platform desktop applications in JavaScript and I thought to myself that this should be used for this project. That framework was “Electron”!\n",
      "\n",
      "Electron applications run on two threads, main and renderer. The main thread uses Electron APIs to communicate with the OS to perform native desktop application operations. The renderer thread is responsible for rendering the DOM on the application window. These two threads communicate with each other using the IPC(Inter-process communication) Electron API.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Electron homepage clearly states that “It’s easier than you think” and it is true for most of it but the setup was not that easy. I was going to use the React for the project so I started out by using the electron-react-boilerplate which was also mentioned in the Electron documentation. The problem that I faced with this boilerplate was that it was too bulky and there were a lot of modules installed that were irrelevant to the cause. I required a boilerplate that had just the minimal dependencies to create a React-based Electron application. After extensive research, I decided that I should create one for myself 😬.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bringing in the programming:\n",
      "\n",
      "I started out a simple starter code I found in the documentation. It creates a window and loads an HTML file inside it, which is pretty simple. Next, loading a React application inside that window. I already had a boilerplate for the React application that I created some time ago. Easy things first, I bundled the React application, tried to load the output HTML file in the window but it did not work. I realized I have to make some changes to the Webpack configuration. I use \"/\" as the publicPath in the Webpack output because that is required when the application is served from a server. In the case of Electron, the files will be picked from the local system, so I removed it. Next, I removed the hash file names, removed the split chunks optimizations and used a single file name i.e. renderer.js , and removed the polyfill because it is not required. After all these changes, I ran the bundle in the Electron application again and EUREKA! it worked.\n",
      "\n",
      "Development mode is necessary\n",
      "\n",
      "To the next challenge, running the application in a development mode with HMR(Hot Module Replacement). For the React web application, I use the webpack-dev-server to serve the files and to use HMR. To use the same in Electron, I came across the BrowserWindow.loadURL function that can load a URL inside the Electron application window. Now, I served the React application using the dev server, passed https://localhost:3000/ inside the loadURL function and my application was now running in a development environment. But soon I realized that the HMR was not working so I started to look for a solution. In the electron-react-boilerplate that was mentioned in the documentation, I noticed that they were using the react-hot-loader package too for HMR. I used the same and made sure it was only used in the development build using environment variables set in the Webpack configuration and everything started working smoothly now.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thread communication\n",
      "\n",
      "Next up, using the IPC APIs to communicate between threads. I tried to import the ipcRenderer module in the React application from the electron package but that threw an error. Apparently, electron is a node module and any application using it must be running on a node environment but our renderer.js actually runs in a browser environment. After researching this issue, I found that I can set the nodeIntegration flag, in the BrowserWindow options, to true in order to expose the renderer application with the node environment. With this, I was able to use the ipcRenderer module but I later discovered that the renderer application should not be exposed with the node environment because the node environment exposes the file system to an application and any external injected script might be able to access the file system 🤷🏻‍♂️.\n",
      "\n",
      "I found several solutions that did not work. Finally, I went back to the bulky electron-react-boilerplate and I checked how they handled this issue and I found that they passed the bundled React application JS in BrowserWindow options preload. This actually provides two benefits, first, preload scripts have access to the node environment, and second, it makes the React application load a little faster in the application window. And again EUREKA! this works perfectly. I was able to send and receive messages to and from the main and renderer threads. I created a common.js file too where I can store the communication channel names used by both main and renderer threads.\n",

      "Getting ready for production\n",
      "\n",
      "While reading more of the documentation, I found out that Webpack provides specific targets to bundle JS code for Electron. For bundling renderer code, electron-renderer and for bundling preload script, electron-preload . I use electron-renderer in development mode because in that case, I do not preload my React application JS and I set nodeIntegration to true for development. For production, I use electron-preload and set nodeIntegration to false and I also make sure to remove the renderer.js file reference in the index.html , which can be done in the Webpack configuration, because it will be preloaded. This is how my main window configuration looks like:\n",

      "\n",
      "User-contributed: As the name suggests, this is metadata added by users who are familiar with the data. You can think of this as expert knowledge about the content in the form of annotations that help other users know what the data is and how to use it. This kind of information may include definitions of terms of columns or other details that may help to identify similar datasets.\n",
      "\n",
      "Derived: With this type of metadata (mined from each dataset), we are essentially asking, “What can the data tell us about itself?”. Derived metadata can encompass information such as size, quality, and types of data, number of records, how often the data is updated, last modified date, anomalies, date ranges, and frequent keywords or tokens.\n",
      "\n",
      "Provenance and Lineage: This third layer of metadata is tied closely to the creation, transformation, and usage of the data. It encompasses change history, social details around how the data is being used and applied across an organization, and dependencies: Is it a parent dataset? Is it used to create other datasets? Is it part of other datasets? This type of information is particularly important when trying to understand how a change in one dataset could have a much wider impact.\n",
